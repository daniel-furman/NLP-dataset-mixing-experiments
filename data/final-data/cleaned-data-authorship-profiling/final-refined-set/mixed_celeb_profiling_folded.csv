Im asking the Capitol Commission and the Tennessee Historical Commission to please consider the implications of how hurtful it would be to continue fighting for these monuments When you fight to honor racists you show black Tennesseans and all of their allies where you stand and you continue this cycle of hurt You cant change history but you can change this<sep>.

I am slightly obsessed with this shirt I got in Morocco it is handstitched The colors are muted I normally like bright colors but dont necessarily wear bright colors Anyhow if you have ever seen the movie Confessions of a Shopaholic youd get a better understanding of why it is so hard to get rid of certain pieces of clothing Ps swipe right for another big eyes moment<sep>.

For the first time in my life Im going without lots and lots of makeup These clips show a closer look at my face which is very scary for me you can actually see my freckles Growing up in Hollywood can be hard Its all about looks and the press can be pretty mean why does she look so old why does she look so young why is she too big why is she too skinny As Selena Gomez says the world can be a nasty place kill them with kindness GOD BLESS YOU ALL And with all that love right back to ya Ps just another touch of ROSE<sep>.

Middle pic has no retouches<sep>. Ok call me weird if you want but I really love crystals and rocks During this pandemic Ive had more time to myself so I started a collection of crystals and I now have 33 They are stunning and I pray and meditate with them every darn day I dont have a specific prayer because its different every time depending on what Im going through For instance yesterday I prayed to find more confidence and grace asking my spiritual guides to guide me I usually also burn incense to clear the energy I even used to hold a small rock in my pocket when I was nervous for interviews for good luck Im taking this time to find myself and go back to the things I loved when I was younger When I was little any time I went outside I would rather stay in the driveway and look for pretty rocks than play okay so I was a weird little kid Hmmm I guess some things never change PS in other words go put some damn rocks in your house<sep>. When I was on the Mickey Mouse Club they used to use a spot for me beside the camera so I would stop looking at the camera I would always get in trouble just like her and her name is Britney too yes I know hers is spelled Brittany I saw this and laughed so hard yesterday<sep>. A sneak peek of whats to come with my mini rose shoot Im calling Just a Touch of Rose PS Im not wearing any foundation here Im just wearing some mascara<sep>. I feel like we will look back at this time in quarantine as a huge transitional stage in our lives we dont know when things will go back to normal but we are staying positive and learning so much about ourselves For me I want to thank all my dear sweet real fans for being so damn wonderful I can feel your hearts and I know you can feel mine thank you for your support<sep>. Its the little things and I have no idea what I was thinking when I got a freaking black ink triangle on my right hand During this time of quarantine I really feel like making homemade bread hanging my clothes outside to dry not being on my phone so much spending more time meditating and praying and really finding my inner grace Going back to the old traditions and understanding life has way more meaning also living for the beautiful surprises life is guaranteed to give GOD BLESS YOU ALL<sep>. @<user><sep>. Another BANGING moment PS this was before they were trimmed<sep>. What shall I sing today<sep>.

16,Tim @<user> thanks for hosting us for this It was truly a blast # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty <url><sep>. But first Ill make time for the Nevermind # TimsListeningParty because @<user> is one of my biggest influences and that is one of my favorite albums of all time Its an honor to be doing this the same day as them<sep>. Wow its been so long since I remembered some of these songsthis was so fun you guys now time to get back into the studio and keep moving on the newest stuff # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty<sep>. I still write with Luisfer to this day and its one of the times when I feel the most free Just him me and an acoustic guitar # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty <url><sep>. Moody guitars slides the lyrics of that song also makes use of a lot of hyperbole I guess Im a hyperbolic person when it comes to love Or in general Ha # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty<sep>. Que Me Quedes Tu was a love song I did with Luisfer Ochoa my longtime collaborator from Pies Descalzos to today That song very much has the sound of what Luisfer and I do together # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty <url><sep>. I was using the writing device of personification but in the opposite way instead of making an object or an animal into a person I did the contrary # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty<sep>. Poem to a Horsethis was me at the height of poetic hyperbole Essentially I was comparing a love interest to a horsewho couldnt appreciate what he had before him # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty <url><sep>. Its a song that has stood the test of time really wellI didnt perform it on this last tour but I might have to bring it back Its so nice to hear it again # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty <url><sep>. Te Dejo Madrid is one of the few Spanishlanguage songs from Laundry Serviceand its still one of the most fun to perform In Madrid especially # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty<sep>. @<user> BrendanDrums has been with me for almost my entire career and we still do things together like Girl Like Me but this is one of the first we did just me and him # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty <url><sep>. Fool is a song that I wrote with my drummer @<user> # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty <url><sep>. That tour the Tour of the Mongoose was my biggest tour yet and we had so much fun It was incredible for me to be able to perform to so many people in countries Id never even been to before # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty <url><sep>. Ready For The Good Times was one of the most fun for me to perform on tourthere was a dance that went with it that I really enjoyed # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty <url><sep>. The One was the last single off of Laundry Service The power ballad Shakira lol # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty<sep>. Rules was the song where I first performed playing drums on tour I had played drums before but that was the first song where I played them onstage # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty<sep>. It was one of the only times I actually listened to the label about which song to put out and when He convinced me # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty<sep>. When I played my music for the label Tommy Mottola went crazy for that song I wanted Objection to be the first single but I was totally wrongand he was totally right # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty <url><sep>. I was in a moment where I was in love with Latin folkloric music and I wanted something that honored that # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty<sep>. Whenever came out of me wanting to do a song with Andean sounds and instruments like the pan flute and the bombo leguero # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty <url><sep>. I was a huge fan of Herb but after that shoot I dont think he was a huge fan of mine because I took 7 hours in hair and makeup before shootingI was nervous ok # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty<sep>. Underneath was another of my first songs written in Englishwe did the video with Herb Ritts an iconic photographer whose black and white images I really loved and who I was dying to work with # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty <url><sep>. I wanted to do a tango because at the time I was dating an Argentinian and was learning the dance and was immersed in the Argentine culture # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty<sep>. Objection was the very first song I wrote in English on a mattress in the bedroom of my Miami apartment with a thesaurus in hand when I could barely speak the language # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty <url><sep>.

One thing we can all do to honour the struggle for racial justice in the US is to interrogate understand and dismantle the racist structures of our own countries The UK is the country I was brought up in the country that I vote in and a country whose own history of systemic racism has shaped those elsewhere American and British histories of racial oppression are very much intertwined But it wasnt until I became a student in an American university and was taught British history from an outsiders perspective that I really started to understand the racial violence that scars British history As a child I grew up with a school curriculum that totally glossed over British colonialism and British slavery And any teaching around black civil rights movements were focussed on the American experience as @<user> points out in her book Black History Month in the UK often ends up offering British children timelines of American activists For me understanding our past is a crucial part of understanding the injustices and inequalities of our present and remaking our future as a nation Our school education system is key the stories the national curriculum tells us about who we are and the voices it centres create a blueprint for how we interpret and interact with the world around us As an adult Ive benefited from the work of people like @<user> David Olusoga @<user> @<user> @<user> Paul Gilroy Stuart Hall and many others to help me understand my countrys history But this learning needs to start much much earlier if we are to dismantle deeprooted systems of oppression and injustice Thank you to all the historians teachers activists and students who are paving the way for a truly antiracist education system<break><break>First image by @<user> The True Crown This image is part of I Am Sugar 2018 a series of photographs that respond to Stuart Halls 1991 essay Old and New Ethnicities in which Hall writes I am the sugar in the bottom of the English cup of tea The work appeared as part of Get Up Stand Up Now @<user> in 2018<break><break>Swipe for a guide brilliantly put together by @<user><sep>.

Over the last few years when people would talk to me about a concern of theirs or a problem they faced I found myself saying Well you and me both A lot of us are worried about the same things and going through the same experiences Over the last few months Ive been having conversations with some of the most fascinating people of our time about how they see our world right now in ways big and small I spoke with Stacey Abrams about voting rights and romance novels with Sybrina Fulton about grief and finding moments of joy with Samin Nosrat about the lessons we can learn from failure and about cooking dried beans so theyre actually edible and so much more I hope youll listen and subscribe when You And Me Both my new podcast with @<user> launches on Sept 29<sep>. Senate Republicans set a new precedent for electionyear Supreme Court vacancies in 2016 And that new precedent which they all defended incredibly passionately is to wait for the next president<sep>. When Ruth Bader Ginsburg came to be interviewed for the Supreme Court vacancy Bill had to fill she was told that it would be a casual interview on a Sunday afternoon Bill knew that she was coming so he got out of his Sunday afternoon footballwatching clothes and put on a suit and tie and she came in very casually dressed She was a little embarrassed about coming to The White House and seeing the president when she was not properly attired But they hit it off They had an extraordinary conversation about the Constitution and the role of the courts It was a masterclass <break><break>Ruth Bader Ginsburg was someone I had looked up to for a long timeas a young lawyer and throughout my time practicing and teaching law She believed that the Constitution had to be interpreted as providing for the equal rights of men and women She understood there were certain assumptions in the law that favored or disfavored men as well as women and had the brilliant insight that she could demonstrate that lack of equality by litigating on behalf of men <break><break>Her great gift was not only being a brilliant lawyer litigator and judge but also a warm and empathetic human being She felt the loss of respect and rights that her clients felt And she felt compelled to try to right those wrongs<break><break>This is a devastating personal loss for so many But more than that it is a devastating loss for our country Her memory is already a blessing May it also be a call to continue her work for justice and equality under the law<sep>. Justice Ginsburg paved the way for so many women including me There will never be another like her Thank you RBG<sep>.

I totally forgot I had this bad boy in my camera roll filmed and edited on my phone using @<user> I uploaded a longoverdue vlog to YouTube had this to run alongside it <break>Using @<user> amazing slutty brownie recipe I decided to bake these and OH MY GOODNESS when I tell you they are mouth wateringly delicious I mean it <break>Check out Janes Instagram website for lots more amazing recipes if youd prefer to watch a behind the scenes version of me baking these head to my YouTube channel<sep>. When you see your bestie after 3 months but still need to stay 2 meters apart cant go inside swipe for lovely photos slowly turning silly haha<sep>. I am muting my social media in solidarity with the Black community and in protest against continued injustice so that Black voices can be heard and listened to Using this time to continue to educate myself as much as I can If you are also doing the blackout the work you put in today to learn and listen must continue forever to make a difference Have conversations with your friends family members read watch listen # blackouttuesday Blacklivesmatter have taken out the Black lives matter hashtag as people pointed out it was making it hard for others who needed the hashtag for help resources to find information<sep>. Day 30 Let it bloom <break>It didnt feel right to continue with come what may posts without putting what I put up on my stories earlier here for anyone that didnt see it After reading so many eloquent perfectly worded posts today I wobbled a bit with how to verbalise what I wanted to say or whether or not it would be perfect or make sense or be factually correct but in the end I thought my words are better than no words however I expressed them<break>Ill be the first to admit that Im not as educated on racism and its history as I could be so Ive been doing a lot of reading watching a lot of videos over the last couple of days after the murder of George Floyd to try and educate myself further Signing petitions and donating to the appropriate places is SO vital but Its also really important that we all do more to educate ourselves through research resources books have more conversations with family and friends challenge call out our peers diversify the people we follow on social media the businesses we support Im going to continue to read educate myself share things Ive found resourceful and encourage you to do the above too Its not up to black people to educate white people it is up to us to do that do what we can to help eradicate the evil that is racism <break>Its not enough to just not be racist you have to be antiracist Angela Davis <break><break>BLACK LIVES MATTER<sep>. Day 29 Love Took this on our evening walk My two loves @<user> @<user> # comewhatmay<sep>. Day 28 Pamper time Went to my cupboards to choose which products to use for a good endofday cleanse skin pamper session then decided on an impromptu self timer shoot can you spot my phone in the grubby mirror behind me Haha Would love you know what youre using and loving at the moment Spot anything in the cupboard youve triedis on your to try list # comewhatmay ps I cant reach the two empty shelvesso they remain empty<sep>. Day 27 Simple Pleasures I havent actually been for a sunset beach walk yet but its something Im really excited to do simply looking at this photo earlier put me in the best mood so I felt like sharing it in case it does the same for you # comewhatmay<sep>. Day 26 Thankful for <break>You # comewhatmay<sep>. Day 25 Time well spent Weve been so lucky with the weather today beautiful blue skies warm sun Weve pretty much spent most of the bank holiday weekend out in the garden pruning watering digging out weeds Its so therapeutic satisfying once youve sorted out an areaplanted something do you do much with your outdoor space Have you been doing it up since being in lockdown # comewhatmay<sep>. Day 24 Sunday Funday Alfie I went on a little sunset walk with Nala this evening and it was glorious We also spent a bit of time pretending we knew what we were doing in the garden with some shears too All in all a very wholesome and fun Sunday What did you get up to today # comewhatmay<sep>. Day 23 Social DisDancing One of my favourite memories with @<user> from 2016 Dancing away without a care in the world CANT WAIT TO DO THIS WHEN WE CAN # comewhatmay<sep>. Day 22 Happy Clothes <break>Popping up a late photo 1030pm is late for me guys I bought this happy spring flower combo just as lockdown happened its still my favourite outfit Ive bought for a very long time Its from @<user> # comewhatmay<sep>. Day 21 Staying Connected I didnt get a chance to post this yesterday but I didnt want to miss it as I feel like its such a nice one Now more than ever feeling connected to our friends and family is so important finding ways in which we can hang out and do normal activities is kind of tricky But even if its a text message a little face time catch up or a full on bingo night on video chat with all your friends its nice to do those things so we can all stay a little more connected with one another And in light of # mentalhealthawarenessweek its even more prevalent to be checking in on others This is a hard time for a lot of people being the one who reaches out could make a lot of difference to someone who really needs it Alternatively if you feel like you need to talk about how youre feeling to someone else dont be afraid to reach out and ask for that too At a time like this everyone is dealing with it in their own way and talking about it can make such a difference I cant wait for the day we all get to meet up with each other but until then dont be afraid to say you need to talk there will always be someone will want to listen # comewhatmay What have you been doing to stay connected with your friends and family<sep>. Day 20 Golden Hour Bit of a sunset throw back photo here havent taken out the extensions yet haha My day was totally consumed with book editing but the weather was glorious outside Might have to try and make myself a little set up in the shade tomorrow laptop screens just dont work in the sun What did you get up to today Hope youre all feeling good # comewhatmay<sep>. Day 19 self care My idea of the perfect couple of hours A good ol bath pamper an animal crossing session Ive talked about this a bit in a vlog but honestly animal crossing has been the highlight of lockdown and I never thought Id say that Alfie practically had to beg me to play it Self care isnt just about caring for yourself in a physical sense its also about doing something that makes your mind feel better something just for you # comewhatmay<sep>. Day 18 Sunshine through my window <break>This one is pretty self explanatory but I think now more than ever having the sunlight flood in through the windows is so uplifting especially in the morning Daily dose of vitamin D as I put my makeup on # comewhatmay<sep>.

Day 13 Unwind Id say Im pretty good at knowing when I need to slow down unwind its something Ive learnt about myself over the years especially when working from home it can sometimes feel like your day doesnt have an end I know that for a lot of people this time at home has been one of reflection evaluating how much they need to slow down in certain areas of their life On the contrary Ive actually had a nonstop day very much looking forward to unwinding with a bit of animal crossing haha Are you good at slowing down unwinding when life gets a bit manic What has lockdown life taught you Bit of a deeper question today but it will be nice to see your answers if youre happy to share,0,2

Super cuteeeeeee <url><sep>. Youre now on that list <url><sep>. Then cool I thought he was a girl for the last 5 months so I really dont think it makes a difference <url><sep>. Iam getting another rabbit tho but we are adopting one and Smokey will pick based on who he gets along with so Hopefully he doesnt like the ugly girls<sep>. @<user> No but you just seem like the fun police thats all<sep>. Not you policing where I do my day dreaming for a fake dog Im never buying lmao <url><sep>. Am I the only person who fully looks at puppies online knowing they 10000 have no intention of buying one Every other day It hits 11pm and BOOM I got ta window shop for puppies<sep>. @<user> The cute ones I dont wan na be no sea hag Hahaha<sep>. @<user> And I pulled it up in 5 seconds Conspiracy about our frog gills ended Although I do wan na be a mermaid just like everyone else<sep>. I love you guys so much but please read the paper hiccups arent from us having hills and they never concluded that Always READ the source paper guys <url><sep>. Why Is evolution a scary subject or Is it that it comes from this original paper listing it as one of many hypothesis reasons given and then the internet used it for click bait because they know you wont actually read and fishes are cool Here it is <url> <url><sep>. Told you your shits broken <url> <url><sep>. @<user> Naur<sep>. Your internet is broken again <url><sep>. Ive had the hiccups for 57 years<sep>. @<user> @<user> @<user> @<user> @<user> Thankyou for saying this Im happy to see Im not the only one who thinks its overstepping personal boundaries<sep>. @<user> @<user> @<user> @<user> Exactly Thankyou for understanding<sep>. @<user> @<user> Love you<sep>. I love seeing all the kids together <url><sep>. How many of you are actually deep frying a full turkey tho I<sep>. My moms coming to visit tomorrow amp im so excited for her to see how big onyx is now She hasnt been able to visit since his bday<sep>. Its a rabbit can you relax <url><sep>. Turns out our rabbit is actually a boy Luckily Smokey works as a name either way<sep>. Karmas a bitch Lmao<sep>.

Haha thats how I felt when I wrote over this beat I was like am I about to go full yee haw on this beat <url><sep>. I dont think so Ive never heard of anyone paying for them regardless of origin <url><sep>. Its free in the USA <url><sep>. Iam an immigrant we have to have a long list of vaccinations before being granted a green card Doesnt matter if you already them they do a blood test and if your antibodies are too low for certain vaccines you have to redo them so Im pretty familiar with the concept <url><sep>. with that said I will keep being vaccinated for Covid as long as its actively being spread in my community because thats the best way I can help stop it spreading and you should too<sep>. Lets get into that depends how active Covid is in cases example Measles vaccineyou need a shot every 10 years to remain effective but most ppl dont go back because its not something in the community being spread actively therefore not high on your list of shit to do <url><sep>. If you have your vaccination more than 6 months ago you should book an appointment for a booster shot to make sure you still have enough antibodies in your system for it to be effective <url><sep>. If youve been vaccinated as time passes your immunity declines and youll need a booster vaccination to restore the antibodies in your body to a level that gives you real protection I was vaccinated early April so I just got my booster shot yesterday <url><sep>. Its been more than 24hrs now and Im not feeling anything so I think Im in the clear <url><sep>. Thankyou but I dont feel bad Lol <url><sep>. I said Id give an update about getting the booster shot so here it is Nothing happened besides my arm being a bit sore I feel totally normal<sep>. @<user> Im feeling normal still but lets see how it goes when I wake up Honestly Id be surprised if I have any side effects because it takes ALOT for me to be run down<sep>. I dont think theres a person alive on this planet happier than Britney Spears today amp the thought of that really makes me smile<sep>. Just got my booster shot<sep>. I definitely will but all my decorations wont be here yet Once its 100 done Ill share with you guys <url><sep>. Im putting up my Christmas tree tomorrow Fuck it<sep>. Thankyou <url><sep>.

Im nominating my friend Abbie and her family for our first @<user> # HappyPlaceHero<break><break>During lockdown Abbie and her family have had no support for their son Ted who has four limb cerebral palsy epilepsy and severe visual impairment Like many families who have members in the disability community this year felt very uncertain and scary Ted can not sit walk or stand without support He needs 24 care which is hard enough usually but with the challenges of this strange year they felt completely on their own Usually if Ted is having a tough day Abbie or Rich take him for a walk as he loves the different sounds and smells of the local park For Ted this kind of stimulation is essential With Abbies husband Rich working in a demanding job and Abbies parents unable to help as they usually would it left a lot on Abbies shoulders Home schooling two other children Teds twin Monty and older sister Bea as well as meeting Teds needs felt at times almost impossible for Abbie There was also a constant fear that if Ted got sick during the lockdown or had a seizure he would have to be in hospital alone which would be very scary for him as he is unable to communicate easily with strangers Throughout this whole period I have bumped into Abbie locally in the park or on our street and she is always smiling positive and up for a really honest chat about life I nominate Abbie and her family for being so strong throughout this weird year and for inspiring us greatly <break>Head to @<user> to nominate someone now<sep>.

88,Thanks so much to everybody for watching the first season of the iCarly revival You guys are the best and we cant wait for you to see Season 2<sep>. Has anybody ever been told I love you by two guys at the same time I definitely havent Carly handled it better than I probably wouldve # iCarlyFinale<sep>. I love the scene with Spencer and Millicent investing in Freddies app Millicent has a hard shell but she definitely loves Freddie and you always see it when it really counts # iCarlyFinale<sep>. @<user> and I had fun dressing up and wearing flower crowns when we sit on a suitcase and talk about our complicated love lives We decided to do valley girl voices at the end of the scene for Theyre so cute Theyre best friends So cute<sep>. For the treehouse scene where it falls out of the tree during the storm our crew actually built a set that was like a ride at an amusement park A remote controlled the entire set and it flew from side to side on a spring # iCarlyFinale<sep>. We got to make smores and eat them in between takes around the campfire Ive never actually been camping and it was my first time making smores # iCarlyFinale<sep>. George the Bra that tells Ghost Stories was one of my favorite old skits from the original iCarly so I was excited the writers had Beau mention it during the campfire scene # iCarlyFinale<sep>. I think its so cute watching Spencer and Millicent work together in secret to try to help Freddie sell his app # iCarlyFinale<sep>. When Beau offers Carly coke with lime the writers put that in because everyone knows how much I love drinking coke in real life # iCarlyFinale<sep>. Every time @<user> said the line helluva Bidet I couldnt not laugh # iCarlyFinale<sep>. I actually loved the luxury treehouse that Beau gets to stay in at Webicon I wish I could stay in one in real life # iCarlyFinale<sep>. @<user> and I had a lotta fun picking up the smallest twigs and really playing up having no idea how to camp or survive in the wilderness during the scene with the compass<sep>. I actually ate a few of the marshmallows off of Dutchs performance dress # iCarlyFinale<sep>. We switched the opening titles back to the full version of the theme song for the # iCarlyFinale and I asked if we could add in the old shot from the original title sequence where Carly throws her blue cowboy hat in the air<sep>. During the opening scene where the group is packing to go to Webicon I kept messing up the everybody hands in moment I dont think Id ever been in charge of a group huddle before and it was hard to get the timing right<sep>.

Enraged Sickened Heartbroken But never surprised This happens way too often and the videos that go viral are not isolated events It seems that only when caught on camera are bigots MURDERERS even getting investigated or fired unfortunately the only way things will start changing is if all these racist ignorant monsters badge or not have to face the consequences behind bars its not only an issue with black men being killed by cops its an issue every time we see them being treated in even nonviolent situations VERY CLEARLY differently than many veryhighrisk incidents involving white men its an issue that the President is making dangerous public statements about enforcing the shooting of protesters rightfully angered by another UNNEEDED KILLING of another black person DEMANDING JUSTICE WHERE IT IS 100 NEEDED while exactly 28 days earlier he tweeted about white protesters who stood ARMED WITH GUNS protesting a WORLDWIDE HEALTH PANDEMIC as very good people urging the Governor to See them talk to them make a deal This is too an issue about the Karens we see filmed weekly using someones race as a point to try and push their agenda while calling the police in situations where their lives are clearly not actually in danger at all theyre just plain fing racist EVERY TIME feels more disheartening and nauseating because our cries for the Government and Americans to do better seem unheard but even when we feel like what we do isnt enough or cant help we have to do more Keep signing petitions making calls to demand justice speaking out this is not just if you have a big platform it starts in your homes and communities and fighting to make a difference for every life that has been wrongly taken or effected by THE PANDEMIC OF RACISM THIS IS ABOUT BEING AGAINST EVERY SENSELESS ACT OF DISCRIMINATION THAT BURDENS THIS COUNTRY<sep>.

Lets get Seeding Here are a few things for you to keep in mind when you are sowing <break>Make sure your seeds are healthy unhealthy seeds give rise to weak seedlings and they dont grow healthy<break>Weak seeds are lighter in weight they float in water smaller than usual pale in color and mostly with the wrinkled seed cover If storebought make sure to check the expiry date<break> Be sure to store them in a cool dry place away from sunlight and soaking for a few hours before sowing your seeds is a good practice <break>Now before sowing wet the soil or cocopeat a little Dont pour water gentle sprinkle on the top layer Overwatering will drown the seed <break>Very important dont bury the seed too deep place the seeds no more than 12 cm in the soil any deeper and the seedling will have trouble popping out <break>Never pack the soil or cocopeat very tight sow in loose soil<break>If you can cover the seeded area for 23 days till you see some sprouting and water with care Not too much just wet the top layer <break>If you germinated in a nursery bag or tray and need to transplant to your pot or garden do it after you have 34 true leaves gently<break>If you are growing hydroponically you can just move the coco coin in a net pot straight into NFT Channel <break>Show me your sowing pictures using # GrowWithMe<sep>.

144,"This Veterans Day I want to share Tom Voutsoss story He served in the US Marine Corps and has continued to live a life dedicated to public service Through @<user> hes helping hardworking folks buy their own home <url><sep>. To every veteran and their family we thank you for your service and sacrifice to our country <url><sep>. @<user> SpeakerPelosi and these members of Congress are making it clear that the United States is back and will continue to lead the way on climate change We would not have met our Paris goals without them and now theyre working to do even more <url><sep>. Young people have more at stake in the fight against climate change than anyone else I had a chance to talk with some young people who are helping lead the fight and could not be more impressed by their courage creativity and persistence They give me hope <url><sep>. If you care about climate change @<user> new book Speed amp Scale An Action Plan for Solving Our Climate Crisis Now offers concrete steps that we can all take to make a difference <url><sep>. Thats why if were going to act on the scale thats required climate change cant be seen as another opportunity to score political points We need everybody And young people in particular have an opportunity to make a real difference<sep>. But once again progress is partial Most nations have failed to be as ambitious as they need to be and the escalation of ambition that we anticipated in Paris six years ago has not been uniformly realized<sep>. The good news is that countries around the world recognize this is a decisive decade if we want to avoid a climate disaster and are setting important goals for 2030 Theyve also promised to help countries move away from fossil fuels and deal with the effects of climate change<sep>. I spoke at COP26 in Glasgow about whats happened in the six years since the Paris Agreement and how much further we still need to go to control climate changehttpstcoan9xxwrOQC<sep>. Weve done some important work since the Paris Agreement was signed six year ago but were still nowhere near where we need to be on climate Watch live from # COP26in Glasgow as I talk about the steps we can take to combat climate changehttpstcofpoGbnNehm<sep>. Five years ago the Paris Agreement went into effect Paris provided an important framework in the fight against climate change but it wasnt enough Thats why Ill be speaking in Glasgow on Monday about the road ahead and what young people in particular can do to help <url><sep>. Visit <url> to find your polling location And if you have any questions call the voter hotline at 8333368683<sep>. Today is Election Day and so much of what we care about is on the ballotfrom access to health care to bringing our economy back from COVID19 to combating climate change We need everybody going out to vote So make a plan to vote and make your voice heard<sep>. Signing the Paris Agreement to fight climate change was one of my proudest moments in office But it was always a foundation to build on As world leaders gather for COP26 I shared some reflections on the road to Paris and the young activists who are pushing us further <url><sep>. In a country as large and diverse as ours progress can often feel frustrating and slow with small victories accompanied by frequent setbacks But once in a while its still possible to take a giant leap forward Thats what the Build Back Better framework represents <url><sep>. Climate change isnt a distant environmental issueits already having an immediate impact on our lives including huge national security implications as more communities come under stresshttpstcowLnJgynwCs<sep>. When you look at the history of big social movements theyre usually started and sustained by young people who put in the work to make it happen As we look to COP26 Im inspired by the young people using their voices in the fight against climate change <url><sep>. It was great to be back in New Jersey Theres too much at stake in this election to sit it out Lets keep New Jersey moving forward by reelecting @<user> and Democrats up and down the ballot Make a plan to vote earlyand get everyone you know to do the same <url><sep>. Virginians delivered for me twice and now Im asking them to do it again by electing @<user> as their next governor Every bit of progress in Virginia is at stake in this electionand theres no time to waste Make a plan to vote early at <url> <url><sep>. Some of the most important changes often start in state legislatures Thats why Im proud to support these candidates for the Virginia state legislature I hope youll join me and the @<user> in giving them your vote <url><sep>. Glad I had a chance to talk with our new champs I really am proud of this team and their work this season <url><sep>. At a time when voting rights are being rolled back the Freedom to Vote Act would strengthen our democracy and give more Americans a voice Thats why the Senate should do the right thing and protect what so many generations fought so hard to secure<sep>. It was great speaking with the @<user> Advisory Council and hearing more about the work theyre doing to make a difference in the lives of boys and young men of color across the country <url><sep>. General Colin Powell understood what was best in this country and tried to bring his own life career and public statements in line with that ideal Michelle and I will always look to him as an example of what Americaand Americanscan and should be <url><sep>. Congratsto our new WNBA champs @<user> I couldnt be prouder of this team they worked hard for this moment and have made our city proud <url><sep>. Today we lost an icon with the passing of Timuel Black Over his 102 years Tim was many things a veteran historian author educator civil rights leader and humanitarian Michelle and I send our thoughts to his family and everyone who loved him <url><sep>. I was deeply saddened to learn about the passing of General Ray Odierno after a battle with cancer He devoted his life to serving this country and for that I will always be grateful Michelle and I send our thoughts to his wife Linda and their children <url><sep>. Congratulations to Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov This award is a tribute to their extraordinary courage and the enduring value of factbased journalism and freedom of expression which is under threat in far too many places today <url><sep>. And of course Im excited for my @<user> to be back in the playoffs Its going to be hard to top a walkoff home run on the Field of Dreams but if any team can do it its this one Go Sox <url><sep>. Its always good to be from Chicago but this year is especially sweet Congratulations to the @<user> for making it to the WNBA finals and to the legend @<user> for making all of us proud Well be rooting for you <url><sep>. If we dont stand up for democracy well see this type of gerrymandering happen in even more states Its why @<user> is fighting for # FairMaps And its why the Senate must pass the Freedom to Vote Act to protect our communities from partisan gerrymandering<sep>. And in Georgia Republicans released a congressional map that decreases the voting power of communities of color including African Americans in a historically Black district and ignores how the state has changed<sep>. In Texas for example Republicans recently passed a law making voting harder especially for people of color Now theyre advancing a new congressional map thats tilted in their favor and doesnt reflect the states growth <url><sep>. Right now state legislatures across the country are setting new boundaries for state legislative and congressional districts And in many states Republicans are drawing maps that allow them to hold onto power<sep>. Our latest production from Higher Ground Ada Twist Scientist is now on Netflix Based on the book series the show will continue the work we started at the White House Science Fair We hope it inspires more young people to discover science and use their imagination to create <url><sep>. Happy anniversary Miche Over the past 29 years Ive loved watching the world get to know you not just as a daughter of the South Side but as a mother lawyer executive author First Lady and my best friend I cant imagine life without you <url><sep>. Happy 97th birthday President Carter Thank you for the extraordinary example of lifelong service that youve set for all of us<sep>.

Michelle and I had fun surprising some of the hardworking women from the Chicago Women of Trades Were grateful for the work theyre doingnot only to build the Obama Presidential Center but also to make it easier for more people to follow their example <url><sep>. It was great meeting our newest class of @<user> Scholars at @<user> Young leaders like them are the source of my hope and I believe they will power a brighter future for all of us <url><sep>. Chicago will always be an important place to @<user> and me which is why were excited to celebrate the virtual ground < <break> > ing for the Obama Presidential Center in Chicagonext weekIts been a long time coming and we cant wait to see this project come to life <url><sep>. If we want to give our children and grandchildren a brighter future the wealthiest Americans and large corporations must pay their fair share in taxes <url><sep>. The repeal of Dont Ask Dont Tell allowed these two Marines to be true to themselves while serving in our military Listen to their story <url><sep>. Ten years ago today we repealed Dont Ask Dont Tell Today our military is stronger and our country is safer because patriotic Americans no longer have to live a lie in order to defend the country they love <url><sep>. Wishing my friend @<user> the best in Canadas upcoming election Justin has been an effective leader and strong voice for democratic values and Im proud of the work we did together<sep>. The Freedom to Vote Act just introduced in the Senate would strengthen our democracy by making it easier for people to vote and harder for politicians and special interests to drown out the voices of ordinary Americans I support it and every Senator should do the same<sep>. Many of the refugees fleeing Afghanistan stood by America and risked everything for a chance at a better life With the launch of <url> we can support our new Afghan neighbors and reaffirm our common humanity I hope youll join us <url><sep>. Today we honor the nearly 3000 men women and children who died on September 11 2001 and the heroes who have always run towards danger to do whats right Lets never forget that day and lets never take them for granted <url><sep>. It was great speaking with @<user> Murthy and the COVID19 Community Corps volunteers across the country whove been spending their time and energy encouraging their communities to get vaccinated Their work is making a difference and will help us end this pandemic <url><sep>. California Youve got a big choice to make by September 14 and everything is on the line Your vote could be the difference between protecting our kids or putting them at risk helping Californians recover or taking us backwards Vote no on the Republican recall<sep>. Great memories of an important day 31 million people now have health insuranceand the peace of mind that comes with itthanks to the Affordable Care Act Now @<user> is committed to making it even stronger through his Build Back Better plan <url><sep>. The pandemic has devastated communities everywhere But the young leaders in our newest class of @<user> Scholars studying at @<user> and @<user> give me hope for a better future Congratulations Scholars <url><sep>. Labor Day is about honoring folks like Maurice Harrisa devoted husband and father of five who has spent his career working in the trades in Chicago Hell soon help build our Obama Presidential Center Heres his incredible story <url><sep>. This Labor Day lets honor all the working men and women who make this country what it isand the American labor movement that has helped protect them especially during this pandemic<sep>. Michelle and I are thinking of everyone affected by Hurricane Ida and were grateful to the first responders doing heroic work Here are some ways to support those in need <url><sep>. May God bless the memory of those we lost and protect those who remain in harms way<sep>. Our hearts go out to the families who lost a loved one and to everyone continuing the mission in Kabul Were also thinking of the families of the Afghans who died many of whom stood by America and were willing to risk everything for a chance at a better life<sep>. As president nothing was more painful than grieving with the loved ones of Americans who gave their lives serving our country As President Biden said these service members are heroes who have been engaged in a dangerous selfless mission to save the lives of others<sep>. Like so many of you Michelle and I were heartbroken to hear about the terrorist attack outside the Kabul airport that killed and wounded so many US service members as well as Afghan men women and children<sep>. Yesterday the House passed the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act that will help Americans everywhere make their voices heard Now the Senate needs to follow the Houses lead Call your Senators and ask them to do the right thing Our democracy is on the line <url><sep>. The Olympics may be over, but the @Paralympics are just getting started. Many of the athletes on @TeamUSA have traveled amazing journeys to reach the top of their sport, and I’ll be cheering them on.

Tonight I am asking you to believe in Joe and Kamalas ability to lead this country out of these dark times and build it back better But heres the thing no single American can fix this country alone Not even a president Democracy was never meant to be transactionalyou give me your vote I make everything better It requires an active and informed citizenry So I am also asking you to believe in your own abilityto embrace your own responsibility as citizensto make sure that the basic tenets of our democracy endure <break> <break>Because thats what at stake right now Our democracy<break> <break>Look I understand why many Americans are down on government The way the rules have been set up and abused in Congress make it easy for special interests to stop progress Believe me I know I understand why a white factory worker whos seen his wages cut or his job shipped overseas might feel like the government no longer looks out for him and why a Black mother might feel like it never looked out for her at all I understand why a new immigrant might look around this country and wonder whether theres still a place for him here why a young person might look at politics right now the circus of it all the meanness and the lies and crazy conspiracy theories and think whats the point <break> <break>Well heres the point this president and those in powerthose who benefit from keeping things the way they arethey are counting on your cynicism They know they cant win you over with their policies So theyre hoping to make it as hard as possible for you to vote and to convince you that your vote doesnt matter Thats how they win Thats how they get to keep making decisions that affect your life and the lives of the people you love Thats how the economy will keep getting skewed to the wealthy and wellconnected how our health systems will let more people fall through the cracks Thats how a democracy withers until its no democracy at all <break> <break>We cant let that happen Do not let them take away your power Do not let them take away your democracy Make a plan right now for how youre going to get involved and vote Do it as early as you can and tell your family and friends too<sep>. nan<sep>.

Choosing a vice president is the first important decision a president makes When youre in the Oval Office weighing the toughest issues and the choice you make will affect the lives and livelihoods of the entire country you need someone with you whos got the judgment and the character to make the right call Someone whose focus goes beyond selfinterest to consider the lives and prospects of others<break> <break> @<user> JoeBiden nailed this decision By choosing Senator @<user> as Americas next vice president hes underscored his own judgment and character Reality shows us that these attributes are not optional in a president Theyre requirements of the job And now Joe has an ideal partner to help him tackle the very real challenges America faces right now and in the years ahead <break> <break>Ive known Senator Harris for a long time She is more than prepared for the job Shes spent her career defending our Constitution and fighting for folks who need a fair shake Her own life story is one that I and so many others can see ourselves in a story that says that no matter where you come from what you look like how you worship or who you love theres a place for you here Its a fundamentally American perspective one thats led us out of the hardest times before And its a perspective we can all rally behind right now <break> <break>Michelle and I couldnt be more thrilled for Kamala Doug Cole and Ella This is a good day for our country Now lets go win this thing<sep>. I will never forget the commitment to reconciliation and peace that I encountered in Hiroshima in 2016 What I said remains true The memory of August 6 1945 must never fade it allows us to fight complacency It fuels our moral imagination It allows us to change<sep>. Im proud to endorse this diverse and hopeful collection of thoughtful empathetic and highly qualified Democrats Together these candidates will help us redeem our countrys promise by sticking up for working class people restoring fairness and opportunity to our system and fighting for the good of all Americansnot just those at the top They make me optimistic about our partys chances in November and about our countrys future long after that So if youre in one of their districts or states make sure you vote for them this fall And if you can vote earlyby mail or in person<sep>.

This pandemic is far from overand our medical professionals continue to put their lives on the line to keep our country going @<user> and I had a chance to thank Dr Spencer for his work during the Ebola crisis and this current pandemic<sep>. The best way for us to honor Johns legacy is to embrace the message he hoped would outlive himself that any one of us has the power to enact change John was a onceinageneration hero and leader but make no mistakehe believed more than anyone that the ability to change the state of things lives in the everyday citizen and comes to fruition through the simplest of acts<break> <break>John would have wanted us to honor his legacynot with defeat and complacencebut with action Passing the John Lewis Voting Rights Act is a start While were at it lets go further Lets make sure to automatically register every citizen to vote Lets give back the right to vote to the formerly incarcerated who have served their time Lets abolish the practices that intentionally make it difficult to cast a ballot particularly in communities of color Lets roll back the Senate filibuster and end gerrymandering These suppressive roadblocks inhibit the strides that John took for us And while rectifying them may seem like lofty ambitions John pulled us closer to their fulfillment and together we can continue inching forward<break> <break>What made him so bold was his unflappable belief in progress If you want to honor his legacy make sure you and everybody you know registers to vote votes early or requests to vote by mail Thats how we actualize the better tomorrow in which John was courageous enough to believe in<sep>.

As we continue to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act I thought I would share the stories of three young activists leading the charge in the disability rights movement Storm Hari and Noah are working in their communitiesat their schools places of work neighborhoodsto advocate for a future that is more inclusive and accessible for all people<break><break>Through storytelling Storm uses her work as a producer to expand representation in the media She wants to make sure that the stories of people in the Deaf communityone that shes proud to be a part ofarent ignored As a student studying Psychology at UC Berkeley Hari educates his peers by sharing his experience as a minimally speaking autistic while teaching a semesterlong class on autism While working as a coordinator for Chicago Adapt Noah founded an organization to advocate for disability rights for international firstgeneration and immigrant students with disabilities<break><break>Change happens from the ground upand these three are leading the way in their communities<sep>. Our second film from Higher Ground is @<user> the story of the young people who met at Camp Jened and together would go on to lead the disability civil rights movement To celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act I got the chance to talk to the next generation of activists and advocates in the disability rights movement Through weekly virtual workshops theyve been continuing the work seen in Crip Camp by training and empowering the next generation of leaders These grassroots activists remind us that when people get involved and recognize their own powerthey can achieve extraordinary change And we couldnt be prouder of them<sep>. I sat down with @<user> to talk about the most pressing issues of our time Hes exactly the leader we need right nowwith the vision the plans and character to move America forward<break><break>Its going to take all of us to get him elected Lets get to work JoeBidencomtogether<sep>. When @<user> and I first came into office in 2009 our country was on the brink of a second Great Depressionand our administration had to work quickly to stop the bleeding and lay down new rules of the road on the financial system to make sure it wouldnt happen again<break><break>Today marks ten years since I signed the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act into law It ushered in the vital reforms needed to help our financial system weather a future crisis And it created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau which has already returned 12 billion to consumers taken advantage of by financial institutions<break><break>Wall Street reform was a step in the right direction for holding big banks accountable and building a fairer economy that works for everybody But this kind of change didnt come easyand it wont stay intact easily either Its something we constantly have to protect and constantly keep working to expand Thats why at the @<user> were working to support a new generation of leaders who can help us do just that<sep>. Not many of us get to live to see our own legacy play out in such a meaningful remarkable way John Lewis did And thanks to him we now all have our marching ordersto keep believing in the possibility of remaking this country we love until it lives up to its full promise<sep>. Today weve lost a founder of modern America a pioneer who shrunk the gap between reality and our constitutional ideals of equality and freedom<break> <break>CT Vivian was one of Dr Kings closest advisors a field general in his movement for civil rights and justice Martin taught us that its in the action that we find out who we really are Reverend Vivian once said And he was always one of the first in the action a Freedom Rider a marcher in Selma beaten jailed almost killed absorbing blows in hopes that fewer of us would have to He waged nonviolent campaigns for integration across the south and campaigns for economic justice throughout the north and never let up knowing that even after the Voting Rights Act and Civil Rights Act that he helped win our long journey to equality was nowhere near finished As Rosa Parks once said of Reverend Vivian Even after things had supposedly been taken care of and we had our rights he was still out there<break> <break>I admired him from before I became a senator and got to know him as a source of wisdom advice and strength on my first presidential campaign His friendship encouraging words and everpresent smile were a great source of inspiration and comfort and personally I will miss him greatly Im only here thanks to CT Vivian and all the heroes in that Civil Rights Generation Because of them the idea of a just fair inclusive and generous America came closer into focus The trail they blazed gave todays generation of activists and marchers a roadmap to tag in and finish the journey And I have to imagine that seeing the largest protest movement in history unfold over his final months gave the Reverend a final dose of hope before his long and welldeserved rest<sep>.

Today Im tipping my hat to all the giants in the Negro Leagues from Satchel Paige to Toni Stone and so many others Their brave example first set 100 years ago changed Americas pastime for the betteropening it up for new generations of players and fans alike<sep>. Five years ago today was a day Ill never forget After decades of protest and organizing and the determination of so many to never give up the Supreme Court declared marriage equality a reality in America As I made some comments in the Rose Garden I looked at so many young members of my staff and I noticed that they and all the people I saw on TV gathered on the steps of the Supreme Court shared the same expression on their faces joy<break><break>Later that day Michelle and I went to Charleston to remember the nine Black Americans who were murdered at Mother Emanuel church and to reflect on the grace that community showedand what it might mean if more of us found the courage to do the same And as night fell at the White House a spontaneous celebration popped up in Lafayette Parka fitting end to a momentous week<break><break>It was a week of progressof real reflection on the painful symbols of our past and continuing injustices today in the battle for the right to health care and in the struggle for full equality for every single American A week of moments that should sustain us in our longer journey to make this country we love more perfectand convince us that we can<sep>. On this day in 1865 more than two years after President Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation and two months after the end of the Civil War the enslaved people of Galveston Texas finally received word that they were free at last <break><break>We dont have to look far to see that racism and bigotry hate and intolerance are still all too alive in our world Just as the enslaved people of Galveston knew that emancipation was only the first step toward true freedom just as those who crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma knew their march was far from finished or the protesters of today continue to fight for Black lives around the countryour work remains far from done As long as people are treated differently based on nothing more than the color of their skinwe can not honestly say that our country is living up to its highest ideals <break><break>And that awareness isnt unpatriotic In fact its patriotic to believe that we can make America better Were strong enough to be selfcritical Were strong enough to look upon our imperfections and strive together to make this country we love more perfect Juneteenth has never been a celebration of victory or an acceptance of the way things are Instead its a celebration of progress Its an affirmation that despite the most painful parts of our history change is possible So no matter our color or our creed no matter where we come from or who we love today is a day to find joy in the face of sorrow and to hold the ones we love a little closer And tomorrow is a day to keep marching<sep>. Todays Supreme Court ruling protecting LGBTQ Americans from workplace discrimination is an affirmation of our countrys founding promise of equality for all Im heartened to think of all those Americans who will no longer live in fear of being fired because of who they are and who they love Its a moment decades in the making a reminder that progress can be slowbut it is always possible And its validation for all those out there speaking out and marching so that our countrys founding promise might touch even more of our people Happy Pride month everybody<sep>. As has always been true at key moments in history its going to depend on young people to go out there and rewrite what is possible So as this years graduates prepare for the next stage of what I know will be a remarkable journey I wanted to give them a few quick pieces of advice<break><break>First do what you think is right not just whats convenient or whats expected or whats easy While you have this time think about the values that matter to you the most Too many graduates who feel the pressure to immediately start running that race for success skip the step of asking themselves whats really important<break><break>Second listen to each other respect each other and use all that critical thinking youve developed from your education to help promote the truth<break><break>Finally even if it all seems broken have faith in our democracy Participateand vote Dont fall for the easy cynicism that says nothing can changeor that theres only one way to bring about change<break><break>America has always made progress because young people dared to hope Your generation is making sure thats true of our presentand our future too I know you can do itI couldnt be prouder of all of you<sep>. The young men and women of color in this country need to know something you matter Your lives matter Your dreams matter <break><break>When I look at the faces of my daughters and nephews and nieces I see limitless potential that deserves to flourish and thrive You should be able to live a life of joy and learn and make mistakes and learn from those mistakes without having to worry about what might happen when you walk to the store or go for a jog or drive down the street or look at some birds in a park So even if youre angry right now I hope youre channeling that anger toward action Because you have the power to make things better Look around at how many Americans want the same thing you do with a sense of urgency that is as powerful and transformative as anything that Ive seen in recent years <break><break>So even as we work to deliver justice for the lives of George Breonna Ahmaud Tony Sean and countless otherswe can all do our part to bring about change by protesting voting and asking for more from our elected officials Join us at Obamaorg and lets get to work<sep>.

Encouraged to discuss with PM @<user> on the sidelines of # COP26 the potential of further investments in science innovation and transformative agriculture RampD as an important foundation for mitigating impact of climate change on small landowning farmers @<user> @<user> <url><sep>. One of my top priorities here at # COP26 is making sure that the world prioritizes scaling clean technology innovation Here is the message I delivered to world leaders earlier today <url><sep>. In addition to investments in reducing emissions to slow climate change we need to help those already impacted by climate change adapt <url><sep>. By bringing the world together at # COP26 we can find more ways to accelerate the development and adoption of the clean technologies we need to reach netzero emissions <url><sep>. At this years UN Climate Conference innovation will take center stage and Im optimistic about the road ahead <url><sep>. I hope Congress passes the Build Back Better Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act fast We cant wait another moment <url><sep>.

The world is so close to ending polio thanks to heroes like Shumaila Rehmani <url> # WorldPolioDay <url><sep>. Our funding is only part of the solution More donors will need to step up to make sure molnupiravir is available to all as quickly as possible<sep>. Everyone deserves equitable access to healthcare Thats why we engaged partners like @<user> and @<user> to find more affordable safe materials that generic manufacturers can use to produce medicines at a lower cost<sep>. Weve done this before In 2017 the @<user> worked with partners and generic suppliers to bring improved HIV therapies to more than 18 million people in lowerincome countries<sep>.

I wrote about two ways to achieve vaccine equity in the future If the world makes the right investments and decisions now we can make things better next time And maybe even make sure there is no next time at all <url><sep>. Still the disparities in access to the COVID19 vaccine are shocking and unjust Only 2 percent of people in lowincome countries have received any COVID19 vaccines And the gap may be getting even larger as richworld governments buy up extra doses to serve as booster shots<sep>. Inequity in health is not new Each year more than 5 million childrenalmost entirely in low and middleincome countriesdie before their fifth birthday from mostly preventable diseases Reducing this gap has been the Gates Foundations top priority for more than 20 years<sep>.

Whiskey is not to be shot You do not do shots of Whiskey It is to be poured Savored And enjoyed fully The Proper way You can drink straight or my personal favorite on the rocks but never shots Whats the hurry Savor it all life is beautifu <url><sep>. For sure this is true The smoothness of my whiskey makes it this way But I am telling you One single cube of ice Just one It will work magic in opening up the liquid for you to fully experience and enjoy all the beautiful notes of Proper Whiskey Take it all in and Savor <url><sep>. @<user> Same thing for sure Slight dilution is needed to open the flavor I just prefer the ice cube tho Its a safer bet Slower release of the dilution plus it is nice and colder Straight water is a dangerous game to play You dilute to much and its not a good time lol<sep>. I appreciate this thank you Proper Twelve has always done amazing in blind taste tests I was speaking on this the other day Depending who the person is bias one way or the other can take over honest opinion I am a big fan of and always confident in blind taste testing <url><sep>. My whiskey is the smoothest on the market bar none But I still do not recommend to drink fully straight Onetwo cubes of ice is perfect The ice opens the flavor inside the glass Think of the liquid as a fist in the barrel you need slight dilution to open it Slight now <url><sep>. I do indeed Forged in Dublin @<user> <url> <url><sep>. @<user> Get the crew and jump a flight Aaron The Scots are always welcome<sep>.

Partidazo de Espaa hoy Enhorabuena chicos y fuerza para los cuartos de final Vamossssss # Espaa # Eurocopa2021 # vamos @<user><sep>. <url><sep>. The Olympic Games always meant a lot and they were always a priority as a Sports person I found the spirit that every sports person in the world wants to live I personally had the chance to live 3 of them and had the honor to be the flag bearer for my country<sep>. I want to send a special message to my fans around the world to those in the United Kingdom and Japan in particular<sep>. Sport prevention of any kind of excess in my body is a very important factor at this stage of my career in order to try to keep fighting for the highest level of competition and titles<sep>. The fact that there has only been 2 weeks between RG and Wimbledon didnt make it easier on my body to recuperate after the always demanding clay court season They have been two months of great effort and the decision I take is focused looking at the mid and long term<sep>. The goal is to prolong my career and continue to do what makes me happy that is to compete at the highest level and keep fighting for those professional and personal goals at he maximum level of competition<sep>. Hi all I have decided not to participate at this years Championships at Wimbledon and the Olympic Games in Tokyo Its never an easy decision to take but after listening to my body and discuss it with my team I understand that it is the right decision<sep>. Los JJOO han significado mucho en mi carrera y siempre fueron una prioridad como deportista encontr el ambiente que todo deportista quiere sentir al menos una vez y personalmente tuve la suerte de vivirlos intensamente en tres ocasiones y ademas ser el abanderado de mi pas<sep>. En estos momentos de mi carrera como deportista una parte importante es la prevencin de cualquier tipo de excesos en mi cuerpo que pudieran impedir seguir luchando en el medio y largo plazo por los ttulos<sep>. El hecho de que haya solo dos semanas entre Roland Garros y Wimbledon este ao no ha ayudado a que mi cuerpo pueda recuperar de la siempre exigente temporada de tierra batida Han sido dos meses de un gran esfuerzo y la decisin que tomo va enfocada al medio y largo plazo<sep>. Es una decisin que nunca resulta fcil de tomar Tras escuchar mi cuerpo y hablar con mi equipo entiendo que es la decisin acertada con el objetivo de alargar mi carrera deportiva y seguir haciendo lo que me hace feliz competir al mximo nivel y seguir luchando<sep>. Hola a todos Quiero comunicaros que he decidido no participar en la prxima edicin de Wimbledon que se disputar del 28 de junio al 11 de julio Tampoco jugar los Juegos Olmpicos previstos finalmente del 24 al 30 de julio<sep>.

322,"If we put the # Gospel at the centre and bear witness to it with fraternal love we will be able to look to the future with hope whatever the tempests great or small we may experience today<sep>. It is my hope and prayer that each of you can joyfully say With Jesus I too am a king I too reign as a living sign of the love of God of his compassion and his tenderness # ChristTheKing <url><sep>. Dear young friends Be free and authentic be the critical conscience of society Be passionate about truth so that with your dreams you can say My life is not captive to the mindset of the world I am free because I reign with Jesus for justice love and peace # WYD<sep>. The kingship of Jesus is completely different than that of the world He did not come to dominate but to serve He did not come amid signs of power but with the power of signs He is not like other kings but he is King for the others # ChristTheKing<sep>. Today Christs invitation to Paul is directed to every one of you young people Get up Do not remain on the ground feeling sorry for yourself Theres a mission waiting for you You too can testify to what Jesus has begun to accomplish in you<sep>. The way we relate to children the extent to which we respect their innate human dignity and fundamental rights expresses what kind of adults we are and want to be and what kind of society we want to build # WorldChildrensDay<sep>. Child labor is the exploitation of children It is the denial of their rights to health education harmonious growth to play to dream It means robbing children of their future and therefore humanity itself<sep>. Dear young people if our world is to arise it needs your strength your enthusiasm your passion <url><sep>. # Prayer is primarily listening and encountering God The problems of everyday life then do not become obstacles but appeals from God himself to listen to and encounter those who are in front of us The trials of life thus change into opportunities to grow in faith and charity<sep>. Saint Joseph you who came from the periphery help us change our vision and to take care of those persons who are discarded or are on the margins of society # GeneralAudience<sep>. Dialogue between members of different religions does not take place simply for diplomacy courtesy or tolerance The goal of dialogue is to establish friendship peace and harmony to share spiritual and moral values and experiences in a spirit of truth and love # DayForTolerance<sep>. I am grateful for all the initiatives of solidarity on the occasion of the # WorldDayOfThePoor I also invite you to repeat the strong moment of witness and prayer that we lived last Friday in Assisi <url><sep>. That is the word that makes hope blossom in the world and relieves the suffering of the poor tenderness We need to overcome the temptation to be concerned only about our own problems we need to grow tender before the tragedies of our world to share its pain<sep>. Let us bring an outlook of hope to our world Let us bring it with tenderness to the poor without judging them For there with them is Jesus because there in them is Jesus who awaits us # WorldDayOfThePoor <url><sep>. A person who is generous helpful meek patient not envious does not gossip brag or lack respect cf 1 Cor 1347 this is a person who builds Heaven on earth That person may not be noticed and yet what he or she does will not be lost because good lasts forever<sep>. What is it that gives solidity to life and will never end Saint Paul tells us Love never ends 1 Cor 138<sep>. We are called to discover Christ in the poor to lend our voice to their causes but also to be their friends to listen to them to understand them and to welcome the mysterious wisdom that God wants to communicate to us through them <url><sep>. It is time that the circle of indifference be broken so as to discover once again the beauty of encounter and dialogue<sep>. It is time that violence against women cease and that they be respected and not treated like bargaining chips<sep>. It is time to be scandalised once again before the reality of children who are starving reduced to slavery tossed about in the water in the aftermath of a shipwreck innocent victims of every sort of violence<sep>. It is time for sleeves to be rolled up so dignity can be restored by creating jobs<sep>. It is time that eyes be opened to see the state of inequality in which many families live<sep>. It is time that the poor be given back their voice because for too long their requests have remained unheard<sep>. Here at the Portiuncula Saint Francis welcomed Saint Clare the first brothers and many poor people who came to him Hospitality means to open the door the door of our house and the door of our heart and to allow the person who knocks to come in<sep>. There can not be a cooperation that generates peace without concrete collective dedication that promotes integral disarmament # ParisPeaceForum2021<sep>. It is time to develop a new form of universal solidarity that is grounded in fraternity love and mutual understanding one that values people over profit one that seeks new ways to understand development and progress # COP26<sep>. If we do not want to live life poorly let us ask for the grace to see Jesus in the poor to serve Jesus in the poor # SaintMartinOfTours<sep>. Faith in Christ in your heart is like Christ in the boat Saint Augustine We wake Christ up in our hearts and then we can contemplate things with his vision because He sees beyond the storm # GeneralAudience<sep>. Let us commit ourselves to fostering an education in fraternity so that the outbursts of hatred that would destroy that fraternity will not prevail The threat of antisemitism still lurking in Europe and elsewhere is a threat that must be defused<sep>. The world needs Christians who know how to demonstrate the beauty of the Gospel by the way they live who are weavers of dialogue models of fraternal life who bring the sweet fragrance of hospitality and solidarity who protect and safeguard life<sep>. Let us # PrayTogether for the people of # Ethiopia so sorely tried by the conflict that has lasted more than a year and has caused numerous victims and a serious humanitarian crisis I renew my appeal for fraternal harmony on the peaceful path of dialogue<sep>. In the # GospelOfTheDay Mk 123844 Jesus proposes the poor wideo as a teacher of faith the sound of her few coins is more beautiful than the grandiose offerings of the rich since they express a life sincerely dedicated to God with unconditional trust<sep>. Let us care for our common home and also for ourselves trying to eliminate the seeds of conflict greed indifference ignorance fear injustice insecurity and violence Humanity has never before had at its disposal so many means for achieving this goal # COP26 # EnvConflictDay<sep>. Consolation is a strength that does not come from ourselves but from the One who is with us Jesus the Godwithus Let us encourage ourselves with this certainty with Gods consolation And let us as the Sacred Heart for the grace of being able to console when it is our turn<sep>. Passion The Heart of Christ is an impassioned heart wounded by love torn open for us on the cross That tenderness and suffering that Heart reveals what Gods passion is man<sep>. Memory To remember means to return with the heart It is good for us to nurture our memory with those who have loved us taken care of us lifted us up The Heard of Jesus reminds us that whatever happens to us in life we are loved<sep>. Contemplating the Heart of Christ we can allow ourselves to be guided by three words memory passion and comfort<sep>. Being a member of the people of God is a gift a responsibility the responsibility of witnessing by our deeds not just our words to Gods wonderful works which once known help people to acknowledge his existence and to receive his salvation # Synod<sep>. May the protection of minors be more and more a concrete ordinary priority within the Churchs educational works May it be the promotion of an open trustworthy and reliable service in strict contrast to every form of domination betrayal of intimacy or silent complicity<sep>. Today before the mystery of death that has been redeemed let us ask for the grace of perceiving adversity with new eyes Let us ask for the strength to know how to live in humble and confident silence that awaits the Lords salvation without complaining and without grumbling<sep>. Let us # PrayTogether that people who suffer from depression or burnout will find support and a light that opens them up to life # PrayerIntention <url><sep>. When we are tempted to judge others badly we must rather reflect on our own weakness It is good to ask ourselves what drives us to correct a brother or a sister and if we are not in some way coresponsible for their mistake # GeneralAudience<sep>. Love is the supreme rule for following the path of Christ it makes us aware of our weakness and merciful and in solidarity with the difficulties and weaknesses of others # GeneralAudience<sep>. There is no time to wait Unfortunately there are too many people suffering from the environmental crisis Urgent and courageous action is needed along with the responsible preparation of a future in which humanity will be capable of taking care of itself and nature # COP26<sep>. To you who pass by think about your footsteps and your final step that it be peaceful These tombs are a message of peace Stop brother and sister stop Stop weapons makers stop<sep>. There is a mysterious solidarity in Christ between those who have already passed to the other life and we pilgrims in this one Our deceased loved ones continue to take care of us from Heaven They pray for us and we pray for them and we pray with them # Prayer # FaithfulDeparted<sep>. Do not be afraid to set your sights higher to allow yourself to be loved and liberated by God Do not be afraid to let yourself be guided by the Holy Spirit Holiness does not make you less human since it is an encounter between your weakness and the power of Gods grace<sep>. Do not be afraid of holiness It will take away none of your energy vitality or joy On the contrary you will become what the Father had in mind when he created you and you will be faithful to your deepest self # UniversalSanctification<sep>. Blessed be Jesus Christ the only Saviour of the world together with this immense flowering of saintly men and women who populate the earth and who have made their life a hymn to God # AllSaintsDay<sep>. The saints who often count for little in the eyes of the world are in reality the ones who sustain it not with the weapons of money and power but with the weapon of # prayer # AllSaintsDay<sep>. I am thinking about the population of Haiti who are living in extreme conditions I ask that all leaders of nations help this country not to leave it on its own How much suffering how much pain there is in that land Let us # PrayTogether for Haiti let us not abaondon them<sep>. This is a moment to dream big to rethink our priorities what we value what we want what we seek and replan our future committing to act in our daily life on what we have dreamed of The time to act and to act together is now # COP26<sep>. The # WordOfGod must be repeated made ones own safeguarded It must reach every aspect of life involve as Jesus says in the # GospelOfTheDay the entire heart the entire soul the entire mind all of our strength Mk 1228 It must resound within us<sep>. Let us build cities that while preserving their respective cultural and religious identity are open to differences and know how to promote them in the spirit of human fraternity # FratelliTutti # WorldCitiesDay<sep>. When we pray we never do so alone even if we do not think about it we are immersed in a majestic river of invocations that precedes us and proceeds after us # Prayer # CommunionOfSaints<sep>. Climate change can be faced with a renewed sense of shared responsibility for our world and an effective solidarity based on justice a sense of our common destiny and a recognition of the unity of our human family in Gods plan for the world # Faiths4COP26<sep>. We often do the bare minimum whereas Jesus invites us to do the maximum possible How many times are we satisfied with doing our duties the precepts a few prayers whereas God who gives us life asks us for enthusaism in life<sep>. The Spirit which flows forth from Jesus Passover is the origin of the spiritual life He changes hearts not our works but the action of the Holy Spirit in us # GeneralAudience<sep>. I express my closeness to the thousands of migrants refugees in Libya I never forget you I hear your cries and pray for you We are all responsibile for these our brothers and sisters who have been victims of this serious situation for too many years Let us # PrayTogether<sep>. Jesus have mercy on me Let us make this prayer our own today Let us repeat it We must ask Jesus who can do everything for everything He can not wait to pour out his grace and joy into our hearts # GospelOfTheDay<sep>. In the # GospelOfTheDay Mk 104652 the faith of Bartimaeus the blind beggar shines He asks everything of the One who can do everything Have mercy on me He doesnt ask for a favour but presents himself he asks for mercy on his person on his life<sep>. To live out a mission means cultivating the sentiments that Jesus has, to believe with Him that those around me are also my brothers and sisters. May His love reawaken our hearts and make us all true missionary disciples. #WorldMissionDay https://t.co/xTjcVjmq2J",1,4

350,"If we make consistent effort based on proper education we can change the world We are selfish thats natural but we need to be wisely selfish not foolishly selfish We have to concern ourselves more with others wellbeing thats the way to be wisely selfish<sep>. The only thing that will bring happiness is affection and warmheartedness When you have a more compassionate mind and cultivate warmheartedness the whole atmosphere around you becomes more positive and friendlier You see friends everywhere<sep>. Anger and aggression sometimes seem to be protective because they bring energy to bear on a particular situation but what needs to be acknowledged is that that energy is blind It takes a calm mind to be able to consider things from different angles and points of view<sep>. Materialistic values can not give us peace of mind So we really need to focus on our inner values our true humanity Only this way can we have peace of mindand more peace in our world<sep>. Please dont think that compassion love and tolerance only belong to religion They belong to human life From compassion we develop selfconfidence that brings inner strength allowing us to act with transparency and candour<sep>. In order to develop our mind we must look at a deeper level Everyone seeks happiness joyfulness but from outsidefrom money from power from big car from big house Most people never pay much attention to the ultimate source of a happy life which is inside not outside<sep>. His Holiness the Dalai Lamas message to COP26 <url><sep>. On the occasion of the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP26 HHDL speaks on the need to tackle climate change as the future of our planet is in our hands <url><sep>. These days its realistic to work for coexistence on global level Its no longer appropriate to thinking only of my country We must educate the young in the ways to achieve genuine world peace taking the entire world the whole of humanity into account on a global level<sep>. Everyone wants to live in a peaceful world but its necessary to understand that what destroys peace is anger and hatred This is why the long term goal is to create inner peace within individuals so contributing to a more compassionate humanity<sep>. Compassion in Action HHDLs message to the 8th Parliament of the Worlds Religions held virtually on October 1718 2021 <url><sep>. Whats past is past nothing can change that But the future can be different if we choose to make it so We have to cultivate a vision of a happier more peaceful future and make the effort now to bring it about This is no time for complacency hope lies in the action we take<sep>. I dont like formality Theres no formality when were born and none when we die In between we should treat each other as brothers and sisters because we all want to live a happy life This is our common purpose and our right<sep>.

HHDL sends 90th birthday greetings to Archbishop Desmond Tutu followed by a short talk on compassion in his message to the 11th Annual Desmond Tutu Peace Lecture on October 7th 2021 <url> <url><sep>. If you are motivated by a wish to help on the basis of kindness compassion and respect then you can do any kind of work in any field and function more effectively with less fear or worry not being afraid of what others think or whether you will ultimately reach your goal<sep>. In my experience what we need is a calm mind and warmheartedness provides a basis for that Thats how we make ourselves happy as individuals in families local communities and nations If we can train those who are young today in these qualities well create a happier world<sep>. When affectionate relations exist between members of a family each one is confident of being able to call on the others for support In a similar way we must constantly remind ourselves of the oneness of humanity<sep>. Negative emotions like attachment and anger are part of our lives but there are antidotes to them We need to reflect not only on the damage anger and fear can do but also on the benefits to be found in cultivating compassion and nonviolence and find a balance between them<sep>. Creating a more peaceful world requires a peaceful mind and a peaceful heart As human brothers and sisters we must live together with affection and respect The only way to solve human problems and preserve the peace is to meet talk and engage in dialogue # PeaceDayChallenge<sep>. HHDL engaged in his morning meditation practice at his residence in Dharamsala HP India Photo by Tenzin Jamphel <url><sep>. The direction of our lives needs to be positive We werent born to cause trouble or do harm to others For our life to be of value I think we must develop good human qualities warmth kindness compassion Then our life will become meaningful and more peaceful happier<sep>. We all have a responsibility to educate our human brothers and sisters Inner values are the ultimate source of happiness not money and weapons whether youre talking about individuals or the whole of humanity<sep>. Even though our society doesnt emphasize it the most crucial use of knowledge and education is to understand the importance of more wholesome action and disciplining the mindessentially the development of a good heart<sep>. HHDL talks about the need for universal responsibility for the whole of humanity to learn to live happily together <url><sep>. It can sometimes seem as if one person will not be very effective However change in the world always begins with an individual who shares what he or she has learned and passes it on to others<sep>. As soon as I wake up I think about altruism I reflect on the verse that says So long as space remains I will remain in order to serve sentient beings This gives me inner strength and determination so theres no longer any danger of destructive emotions arising<sep>. Helping others brings deep satisfaction No matter how powerful we may seem to be our survival depends on the community Clearly the community is crucial to individual happiness so if we make others happy we too derive benefit<sep>. Peace in the world depends on peace within If we have that well approach problems in a spirit of dialogue compassion and respect for the rights of othersalways a better solution than resorting to a use of weapons and force External disarmament depends on inner disarmament<sep>. We should show one another love and help each another It is a mistake to pursue happiness and to seek to the avoid suffering by deceiving and humiliating other people We must try to achieve happiness and eliminate suffering by being generous and warmhearted<sep>. Since we desire the happiness that comes from having a calm mind and such peace of mind arises only from having a compassionate attitude we must make a concerted effort to develop compassion We must use all the events of our daily life to transform our thoughts and behavior<sep>. Education today needs to include principles such as compassion and nonviolence Whats more since we are missing something if we are physically fit but full of anger and anxiety we need to learn about emotional hygiene tackling destructive emotions to find peace of mind<sep>. Like anyone else I too have anger in me However I try to recall that anger is a destructive emotion Scientists say anger is bad for our health it eats into our immune system It destroys our peace of mind We shouldnt welcome it or think of it as natural or as a friend<sep>. We are social animals If someone is angry with you its important to remain warmhearted towards them Todays enemy may become tomorrows friend If they behave negatively towards you and you are hostile in return therell be no end to the trouble between you<sep>. In seeking to find the source of happiness within us we need a map of our mind and emotions We need to understand how to manage our emotions how to counter those that are negative and cultivate those that are positive That is the way to find peace within<sep>. The problems humanity faces today demand a positive mental attitude and a sense of compassion for others I firmly believe we can solve the majority of our problems by developing a sense of universal responsibilitywanting to do something for others without a selfish motive<sep>.

HHDLs message for the International Religious Freedom Summit 2021 held in Washington DC USA on July 1315 2021 <url><sep>. Happiness derived from mere physical comfort tends to be shallow and fleeting It fails to pacify anxiety and fear Whereas if we have a calm mind it is effective in overcoming even physical pain therefore we should not neglect the inner values that are a source of a calm mind<sep>.

HHDL reunites online withArchbishop Desmond Tutu from his residence in India on June 24 2021 on the occasion of the release of their new movie Mission Joy Finding Happiness in Troubled Times <url><sep>. We should use our unique human intelligence to solve challenges we face and never give up or tell ourselves theres no hope If we have a positive goal and were wellmotivated to seek the wellbeing of others no matter how difficult it is to achieve we can remain determined<sep>. I am determined to help young people in any way I can because they are the future of the world And the first step in establishing good communications with other people is to smile I dont like formality Theres no formality when we are born nor when we die<sep>. If we want to see a more peaceful world we have to learn to collaborate Young people shouldnt follow previous patterns of behaviour New conditions like our interdependent globalised world require new ideas Dividing people into us and them is out of date<sep>. People face difficulties in many parts of the world but since all seven billion of us live on this one planet we should be united and stand in solidarity with each other When this blue planet is viewed from space there are no national boundaries to be seen<sep>. Im a human being a citizen of a world in which we are all dependent on each other a world in which we need a greater sense of concern for the welfare of others Wherever I go I like to meet members of the public so I can share these ideas with them<sep>. Today there is too strong a sense of us and them Theres too much sense of my friends or my enemy But we can change that Im committed to the idea of the oneness of humanity As human beings we are all the same Whats more we all have to live together on this planet<sep>. Entering into dialogue and talking things through is the only proper way of restraining people intent on perpetuating violent conflict It is important to make clear that in the 21st century old ways of thinking such as dependence on the use of force are no longer appropriate<sep>. People today may feel anxious about the future but we can take strength from the fact that more and more of us are genuinely concerned to protect the environment taking account of the welfare of the whole of humanity as well as the health of the planet our only home<sep>. The ability to smile seems to be unique to human beings As social animals we need friends Friendship is based on trust and trust grows when we show each other genuine affection If we are honest truthful and of service to others we can also feel selfconfident<sep>. Our intelligence helps us regulate our emotions Fear for example is based on mistrust and a lack of selfconfidence If on the other hand we remain honest and truthful open and tolerant we will not only have greater selfconfidence well easily overcome fear<sep>. There is time for us to create a better happier world but we cant sit back and expect a miracle We each have actions we must take by living our lives meaningfully helping others whenever we can and making every effort to do them no harm<sep>. Our lives depend on hope If you have hope youll be able to overcome problems you face But if youre without hope your difficulties will increase Hope is linked to compassion and loving kindness<sep>. Im sorry to learn that my good friend Gandhian environmentalist Shri Sunderlal Bahuguna has passed away Some years ago he asked me to spread the word about the importance of planting trees and caring for them whenever I can and I promised to do so <url><sep>. Peace of mind and physical wellbeing are closely related Some years ago a scientist at Emory University told me that continuous anger fear and suspicion tend to eat into our immune system Besides peace of mind and warmheartedness bring us confidence<sep>. We are selfcentred and selfish but we need to be wisely selfish not foolishly so If we neglect others we too lose We have to support others We can educate people to understand that the best way to fulfil their own interest is to be concerned about the welfare of others<sep>. Gradually people are beginning to recognize that peace of mind has an important role to play in our day to day lives Mental afflictions like anger fear and frustration detract from our good health so all seven billion human beings alive today need peace of mind here and now<sep>. When were born our mothers show us compassion This is a natural response without which we wouldnt survive Our lives begin with an experience of kindness and compassion Mothers Day is a good day to remember how important compassion can be<sep>. HHDL speaks on Emptiness and Compassion as Antidotes to Destructive Emotions as part of the Science amp Wisdom of Emotions Summit organized by Mind amp Life Institute and the Awake Network on May 5 2021 <url><sep>. Everybody knows that love and compassion are important Now the time has come when were experiencing the limitations of material values Were facing many unnecessary problems So gradually were returning to our basic human values with a new appreciation<sep>. At this critical time, during this alarming Covid-19 surge, I have asked the Dalai Lama Trust to make a donation to the PM-CARES Fund as a token of our solidarity with our Indian brothers and sisters. https://t.co/JOmAv9bCrC",1,5

I presented for # fryties last week a slim necksnake in cream and maroon that came from the now defunct menswear chain Blazer I ruminated on how the misfortune of Blazers name being an English word for a kind of sports coat made it so hard to research the companys history Some of you wellinformed followers were good enough to let me know that Blazer had been founded by one David Krantz and subsequently bought for 5 million by Storehouse Terence Conrans retail conglomerate Mothercare Habitat BHS etc before Storehouse in turn sold the company on to Moss Bros This included Blazers own label tailoring line De Havilland as in the tie I offer up today Next Mr Krantz founded the upmarket casual clothing group Racing Green which he sold for 19 million to Burton in 1996<break><break>Moss Bros and Burton were the two best known names in 20th century British high street menswear Demob suits special occasion hire smart outfits for men who didnt often wear a suit or think too much about clothes Both companies struggled to stay afloat in the rising yet turbid retail waters of the 80s and 90s Fashion foible and fickle fancy make profitability and even solvency a game of Buckaroo in the clothing business You can be forced by shareholder pressure to pay for the services of some dickbrain of a brand consultant or PR guru wholl have you spend gazillions on redesigning and reinventing your shops and radically changing your lines logos and layout Result you alienate your loyal customers and cause snorts of derision from the young who can see with piercing clarity that you are trying to appeal to them And nothing will cause them to stay away more completely than that A painful experience suffered by many a company And this was before the explosion in online retail<break><break>Burton has the happy privilege of belonging to Sir Philip Green of the Arcadia Group now Gone for a Burton indeed But one doesnt wish them ill Its tough out there Nor the Brothers Moss who have dressed men so well for 170 years They at least have managed as far as I can tell to stay independent<break><break>David Krantz is I hope enjoying his money Thanks for tie Mr Krantz<sep>.
