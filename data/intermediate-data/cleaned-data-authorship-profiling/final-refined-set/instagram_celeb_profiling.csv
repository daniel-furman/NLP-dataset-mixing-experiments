Im asking the Capitol Commission and the Tennessee Historical Commission to please consider the implications of how hurtful it would be to continue fighting for these monuments When you fight to honor racists you show black Tennesseans and all of their allies where you stand and you continue this cycle of hurt You cant change history but you can change this<sep>.

Ok call me weird if you want but I really love crystals and rocks During this pandemic Ive had more time to myself so I started a collection of crystals and I now have 33 They are stunning and I pray and meditate with them every darn day I dont have a specific prayer because its different every time depending on what Im going through For instance yesterday I prayed to find more confidence and grace asking my spiritual guides to guide me I usually also burn incense to clear the energy I even used to hold a small rock in my pocket when I was nervous for interviews for good luck Im taking this time to find myself and go back to the things I loved when I was younger When I was little any time I went outside I would rather stay in the driveway and look for pretty rocks than play okay so I was a weird little kid Hmmm I guess some things never change PS in other words go put some damn rocks in your house<sep>. When I was on the Mickey Mouse Club they used to use a spot for me beside the camera so I would stop looking at the camera I would always get in trouble just like her and her name is Britney too yes I know hers is spelled Brittany I saw this and laughed so hard yesterday<sep>. A sneak peek of whats to come with my mini rose shoot Im calling Just a Touch of Rose PS Im not wearing any foundation here Im just wearing some mascara<sep>. I feel like we will look back at this time in quarantine as a huge transitional stage in our lives we dont know when things will go back to normal but we are staying positive and learning so much about ourselves For me I want to thank all my dear sweet real fans for being so damn wonderful I can feel your hearts and I know you can feel mine thank you for your support<sep>. Its the little things and I have no idea what I was thinking when I got a freaking black ink triangle on my right hand During this time of quarantine I really feel like making homemade bread hanging my clothes outside to dry not being on my phone so much spending more time meditating and praying and really finding my inner grace Going back to the old traditions and understanding life has way more meaning also living for the beautiful surprises life is guaranteed to give GOD BLESS YOU ALL<sep>. @<user><sep>.

One thing we can all do to honour the struggle for racial justice in the US is to interrogate understand and dismantle the racist structures of our own countries The UK is the country I was brought up in the country that I vote in and a country whose own history of systemic racism has shaped those elsewhere American and British histories of racial oppression are very much intertwined But it wasnt until I became a student in an American university and was taught British history from an outsiders perspective that I really started to understand the racial violence that scars British history As a child I grew up with a school curriculum that totally glossed over British colonialism and British slavery And any teaching around black civil rights movements were focussed on the American experience as @<user> points out in her book Black History Month in the UK often ends up offering British children timelines of American activists For me understanding our past is a crucial part of understanding the injustices and inequalities of our present and remaking our future as a nation Our school education system is key the stories the national curriculum tells us about who we are and the voices it centres create a blueprint for how we interpret and interact with the world around us As an adult Ive benefited from the work of people like @<user> David Olusoga @<user> @<user> @<user> Paul Gilroy Stuart Hall and many others to help me understand my countrys history But this learning needs to start much much earlier if we are to dismantle deeprooted systems of oppression and injustice Thank you to all the historians teachers activists and students who are paving the way for a truly antiracist education system<break><break>First image by @<user> The True Crown This image is part of I Am Sugar 2018 a series of photographs that respond to Stuart Halls 1991 essay Old and New Ethnicities in which Hall writes I am the sugar in the bottom of the English cup of tea The work appeared as part of Get Up Stand Up Now @<user> in 2018<break><break>Swipe for a guide brilliantly put together by @<user><sep>.

Senate Republicans set a new precedent for electionyear Supreme Court vacancies in 2016 And that new precedent which they all defended incredibly passionately is to wait for the next president<sep>. When Ruth Bader Ginsburg came to be interviewed for the Supreme Court vacancy Bill had to fill she was told that it would be a casual interview on a Sunday afternoon Bill knew that she was coming so he got out of his Sunday afternoon footballwatching clothes and put on a suit and tie and she came in very casually dressed She was a little embarrassed about coming to The White House and seeing the president when she was not properly attired But they hit it off They had an extraordinary conversation about the Constitution and the role of the courts It was a masterclass <break><break>Ruth Bader Ginsburg was someone I had looked up to for a long timeas a young lawyer and throughout my time practicing and teaching law She believed that the Constitution had to be interpreted as providing for the equal rights of men and women She understood there were certain assumptions in the law that favored or disfavored men as well as women and had the brilliant insight that she could demonstrate that lack of equality by litigating on behalf of men <break><break>Her great gift was not only being a brilliant lawyer litigator and judge but also a warm and empathetic human being She felt the loss of respect and rights that her clients felt And she felt compelled to try to right those wrongs<break><break>This is a devastating personal loss for so many But more than that it is a devastating loss for our country Her memory is already a blessing May it also be a call to continue her work for justice and equality under the law<sep>.

I totally forgot I had this bad boy in my camera roll filmed and edited on my phone using @<user> I uploaded a longoverdue vlog to YouTube had this to run alongside it <break>Using @<user> amazing slutty brownie recipe I decided to bake these and OH MY GOODNESS when I tell you they are mouth wateringly delicious I mean it <break>Check out Janes Instagram website for lots more amazing recipes if youd prefer to watch a behind the scenes version of me baking these head to my YouTube channel<sep>. When you see your bestie after 3 months but still need to stay 2 meters apart cant go inside swipe for lovely photos slowly turning silly haha<sep>. I am muting my social media in solidarity with the Black community and in protest against continued injustice so that Black voices can be heard and listened to Using this time to continue to educate myself as much as I can If you are also doing the blackout the work you put in today to learn and listen must continue forever to make a difference Have conversations with your friends family members read watch listen # blackouttuesday Blacklivesmatter have taken out the Black lives matter hashtag as people pointed out it was making it hard for others who needed the hashtag for help resources to find information<sep>. Day 30 Let it bloom <break>It didnt feel right to continue with come what may posts without putting what I put up on my stories earlier here for anyone that didnt see it After reading so many eloquent perfectly worded posts today I wobbled a bit with how to verbalise what I wanted to say or whether or not it would be perfect or make sense or be factually correct but in the end I thought my words are better than no words however I expressed them<break>Ill be the first to admit that Im not as educated on racism and its history as I could be so Ive been doing a lot of reading watching a lot of videos over the last couple of days after the murder of George Floyd to try and educate myself further Signing petitions and donating to the appropriate places is SO vital but Its also really important that we all do more to educate ourselves through research resources books have more conversations with family and friends challenge call out our peers diversify the people we follow on social media the businesses we support Im going to continue to read educate myself share things Ive found resourceful and encourage you to do the above too Its not up to black people to educate white people it is up to us to do that do what we can to help eradicate the evil that is racism <break>Its not enough to just not be racist you have to be antiracist Angela Davis <break><break>BLACK LIVES MATTER<sep>. Day 29 Love Took this on our evening walk My two loves @<user> @<user> # comewhatmay<sep>. Day 28 Pamper time Went to my cupboards to choose which products to use for a good endofday cleanse skin pamper session then decided on an impromptu self timer shoot can you spot my phone in the grubby mirror behind me Haha Would love you know what youre using and loving at the moment Spot anything in the cupboard youve triedis on your to try list # comewhatmay ps I cant reach the two empty shelvesso they remain empty<sep>. Day 27 Simple Pleasures I havent actually been for a sunset beach walk yet but its something Im really excited to do simply looking at this photo earlier put me in the best mood so I felt like sharing it in case it does the same for you # comewhatmay<sep>. Day 26 Thankful for <break>You # comewhatmay<sep>. Day 25 Time well spent Weve been so lucky with the weather today beautiful blue skies warm sun Weve pretty much spent most of the bank holiday weekend out in the garden pruning watering digging out weeds Its so therapeutic satisfying once youve sorted out an areaplanted something do you do much with your outdoor space Have you been doing it up since being in lockdown # comewhatmay<sep>. Day 24 Sunday Funday Alfie I went on a little sunset walk with Nala this evening and it was glorious We also spent a bit of time pretending we knew what we were doing in the garden with some shears too All in all a very wholesome and fun Sunday What did you get up to today # comewhatmay<sep>. Day 23 Social DisDancing One of my favourite memories with @<user> from 2016 Dancing away without a care in the world CANT WAIT TO DO THIS WHEN WE CAN # comewhatmay<sep>. Day 22 Happy Clothes <break>Popping up a late photo 1030pm is late for me guys I bought this happy spring flower combo just as lockdown happened its still my favourite outfit Ive bought for a very long time Its from @<user> # comewhatmay<sep>. Day 21 Staying Connected I didnt get a chance to post this yesterday but I didnt want to miss it as I feel like its such a nice one Now more than ever feeling connected to our friends and family is so important finding ways in which we can hang out and do normal activities is kind of tricky But even if its a text message a little face time catch up or a full on bingo night on video chat with all your friends its nice to do those things so we can all stay a little more connected with one another And in light of # mentalhealthawarenessweek its even more prevalent to be checking in on others This is a hard time for a lot of people being the one who reaches out could make a lot of difference to someone who really needs it Alternatively if you feel like you need to talk about how youre feeling to someone else dont be afraid to reach out and ask for that too At a time like this everyone is dealing with it in their own way and talking about it can make such a difference I cant wait for the day we all get to meet up with each other but until then dont be afraid to say you need to talk there will always be someone will want to listen # comewhatmay What have you been doing to stay connected with your friends and family<sep>. Day 20 Golden Hour Bit of a sunset throw back photo here havent taken out the extensions yet haha My day was totally consumed with book editing but the weather was glorious outside Might have to try and make myself a little set up in the shade tomorrow laptop screens just dont work in the sun What did you get up to today Hope youre all feeling good # comewhatmay<sep>. Day 19 self care My idea of the perfect couple of hours A good ol bath pamper an animal crossing session Ive talked about this a bit in a vlog but honestly animal crossing has been the highlight of lockdown and I never thought Id say that Alfie practically had to beg me to play it Self care isnt just about caring for yourself in a physical sense its also about doing something that makes your mind feel better something just for you # comewhatmay<sep>. Day 18 Sunshine through my window <break>This one is pretty self explanatory but I think now more than ever having the sunlight flood in through the windows is so uplifting especially in the morning Daily dose of vitamin D as I put my makeup on # comewhatmay<sep>. Day 17 Books Coffee or in my case a book a pug an iced chocolate which I cant stop drinking on hot days # comewhatmay<sep>.

Day 13 Unwind Id say Im pretty good at knowing when I need to slow down unwind its something Ive learnt about myself over the years especially when working from home it can sometimes feel like your day doesnt have an end I know that for a lot of people this time at home has been one of reflection evaluating how much they need to slow down in certain areas of their life On the contrary Ive actually had a nonstop day very much looking forward to unwinding with a bit of animal crossing haha Are you good at slowing down unwinding when life gets a bit manic What has lockdown life taught you Bit of a deeper question today but it will be nice to see your answers if youre happy to share,F,Zoella

This is an old snap from nearly four years ago but I found it today and wanted to post it to express my gratitude for @<user> <break><break>I very much like talking about mental health and wellbeing it still feels like somewhat of a novelty after so many years in radio and entertainment yet I probably wouldnt be doing so if it wasnt for Stephen Fry As one of the first people in the public eye in modern day culture to explicitly discuss his own mental health he gave everybody a chance to think about their own discuss it a little more openly and helped to normalise the conversation <break><break>As the long standing president of @<user> he continues to make a difference and expand the conversation This picture was taken at the Mind Media Awards four years<sep>. Brand NEW @<user> podcast for you this morning with @<user> <break><break>In this discussion Jo talks about the importance of wisdom alongside intellect and how we can rally against the stressful fast paced world we live in I think I need to re listen to this chat as already this morning the school run forgetting class projects and a lost shin pad have stressed me to the max <break><break>As a shaman Jo has travelled the world and worked with many indigenous peoples and now uses her own wisdom and learnings to help people get back in touch with themselves and nature <break><break>Let me know what you found helpful from this chat below <break>Have a good Monday <break> # wisdom # happyplace<sep>.

Im nominating my friend Abbie and her family for our first @<user> # HappyPlaceHero<break><break>During lockdown Abbie and her family have had no support for their son Ted who has four limb cerebral palsy epilepsy and severe visual impairment Like many families who have members in the disability community this year felt very uncertain and scary Ted can not sit walk or stand without support He needs 24 care which is hard enough usually but with the challenges of this strange year they felt completely on their own Usually if Ted is having a tough day Abbie or Rich take him for a walk as he loves the different sounds and smells of the local park For Ted this kind of stimulation is essential With Abbies husband Rich working in a demanding job and Abbies parents unable to help as they usually would it left a lot on Abbies shoulders Home schooling two other children Teds twin Monty and older sister Bea as well as meeting Teds needs felt at times almost impossible for Abbie There was also a constant fear that if Ted got sick during the lockdown or had a seizure he would have to be in hospital alone which would be very scary for him as he is unable to communicate easily with strangers Throughout this whole period I have bumped into Abbie locally in the park or on our street and she is always smiling positive and up for a really honest chat about life I nominate Abbie and her family for being so strong throughout this weird year and for inspiring us greatly <break>Head to @<user> to nominate someone now<sep>.

Sometimes the best thing you can do is NOTHING Ive had some really interesting conversations this week One with a guests for series 8 who Im beyond excited about and another with my friend @<user> <break>Both conversations lead to this Often we react instantly due to emotion or habit and usually these actions dont lead to the peace we seek Were taught to try and fix things fight for what we want and actively seek peace but sometimes the best thing to do is nothing Im not used to this approach as Im a fixer but Im really looking forward to giving it a go<sep>.

Enraged Sickened Heartbroken But never surprised This happens way too often and the videos that go viral are not isolated events It seems that only when caught on camera are bigots MURDERERS even getting investigated or fired unfortunately the only way things will start changing is if all these racist ignorant monsters badge or not have to face the consequences behind bars its not only an issue with black men being killed by cops its an issue every time we see them being treated in even nonviolent situations VERY CLEARLY differently than many veryhighrisk incidents involving white men its an issue that the President is making dangerous public statements about enforcing the shooting of protesters rightfully angered by another UNNEEDED KILLING of another black person DEMANDING JUSTICE WHERE IT IS 100 NEEDED while exactly 28 days earlier he tweeted about white protesters who stood ARMED WITH GUNS protesting a WORLDWIDE HEALTH PANDEMIC as very good people urging the Governor to See them talk to them make a deal This is too an issue about the Karens we see filmed weekly using someones race as a point to try and push their agenda while calling the police in situations where their lives are clearly not actually in danger at all theyre just plain fing racist EVERY TIME feels more disheartening and nauseating because our cries for the Government and Americans to do better seem unheard but even when we feel like what we do isnt enough or cant help we have to do more Keep signing petitions making calls to demand justice speaking out this is not just if you have a big platform it starts in your homes and communities and fighting to make a difference for every life that has been wrongly taken or effected by THE PANDEMIC OF RACISM THIS IS ABOUT BEING AGAINST EVERY SENSELESS ACT OF DISCRIMINATION THAT BURDENS THIS COUNTRY<sep>.

Lets get Seeding Here are a few things for you to keep in mind when you are sowing <break>Make sure your seeds are healthy unhealthy seeds give rise to weak seedlings and they dont grow healthy<break>Weak seeds are lighter in weight they float in water smaller than usual pale in color and mostly with the wrinkled seed cover If storebought make sure to check the expiry date<break> Be sure to store them in a cool dry place away from sunlight and soaking for a few hours before sowing your seeds is a good practice <break>Now before sowing wet the soil or cocopeat a little Dont pour water gentle sprinkle on the top layer Overwatering will drown the seed <break>Very important dont bury the seed too deep place the seeds no more than 12 cm in the soil any deeper and the seedling will have trouble popping out <break>Never pack the soil or cocopeat very tight sow in loose soil<break>If you can cover the seeded area for 23 days till you see some sprouting and water with care Not too much just wet the top layer <break>If you germinated in a nursery bag or tray and need to transplant to your pot or garden do it after you have 34 true leaves gently<break>If you are growing hydroponically you can just move the coco coin in a net pot straight into NFT Channel <break>Show me your sowing pictures using # GrowWithMe<sep>.

Hey guys this is probably the most personal post Ive ever shared As you know Ive been very open about my mental health journey and feel that this is equally important Years ago I underwent breast enhancement surgery Prior to the surgery I constantly felt my body was less than and thought this change would make me feel more whole and more secure about myself And for a short period of timeit did But little by little I began struggling with minor health issues that just were not adding upfood sensitivities as well as gut issues full story on @<user> that I thought could be caused by my implants So last winter I decided to undergo implant removal<break><break>This journey has been one of growth self discovery self acceptance and most importantly selflove This picture above was taken two months after my explant surgery and I think you can tell just how happy I am to finally be fully me Over the years Ive met with many holistic and nonholistic doctors and learned the importance of living a nontoxic life Im super excited to share with you what Ive learned thus far and would love for you to take this journey with me by following @<user> where we take an honest approach to our wellbeing and openly speak to health beauty and everything in between I cant say Im the proudest of the choices I made in the past but I dont regret it because it got me here today Love you all @<user> is NOW LIVE<sep>.

71,To every veteran and their family we thank you for your service and sacrifice to our country <break><break>This Veterans Day I want to share Tom Voutsoss story He served in the US Marine Corps and has continued to live a life dedicated to public service Through @<user> hes helping hardworking folks who traditionally cant get home loans buy their own homes<sep>. Young people have more at stake in the fight against climate change than anyone else I had a chance to talk with some young people who are helping lead the fight and could not be more impressed by their courage creativity and persistence They give me hope<break><break>To all the young people out there as well as those of you who consider yourselves young at heart I want you to stay angry I want you to stay frustrated But channel that anger Harness that frustration Gird yourself for a marathon not a sprint Because thats whats required to meet this challenge Lets get to work<sep>. I spoke at COP26 in Glasgow about whats happened in the six years since the Paris Agreement and how much further we still need to go to control climate change <break><break>The good news is that countries around the world recognize that this is a decisive decade if we want to avoid a climate disaster and are setting important goals for 2030 Theyve also committed to help poorer countries move away from fossil fuels and deal with the effects of climate change But once again progress is partial Most nations have failed to be as ambitious as they need to be and the escalation of ambition that we anticipated in Paris six years ago has not been uniformly realized <break><break>Thats why if were going to act on the scale thats required climate change cant be seen as another opportunity to score political points We need everybody And young people in particular have an opportunity to make a real difference <break><break>Photo Credit UN Climate Change Kiara Worth<sep>. Five years ago today the Paris Agreement went into effect Leaders of nearly 200 nationslarge and small developed and developingmade a commitment to work together to confront a threat to the people of all nations It was proof that for all the divisions in our world when a crisis threatens all of us we can come together to address it<break><break>Paris showed the world that progress is possible and weve made progress in the years since But as important as it was we always knew that Paris wasnt going to solve the climate crisis on its own The commitments we made in Paris were always designed to be a starta foundation for the world to build on<break><break>Thats why the steps President Biden wants to take to reduce emissions and promote clean energy are so important And its why Ill be speaking in Glasgow on Monday about the need to act with more urgencyand how young people in particular can help Because time really is running out<sep>. Signing the Paris Agreement to fight climate change was one of my proudest moments in office But it was always a foundation to build on As world leaders gather for # COP26 I shared some reflections on the road to Paris and the young activists who are pushing us further<sep>. Good conversations dont follow a script Like a good song theyre full of surprises improvisations detours They may be grounded in a specific time and place reflecting your current state of mind and the current state of the world But the best conversations also have a timeless quality taking you back into the realm of memory propelling you forward towards your deepest hopes and dreams <break><break>Sharing these stories reminds you that youre not aloneand maybe helps you understand yourself a little bit better Thats why Bruce @<user> and I recorded our podcast last year and worked together on this book Renegades Born in the USA The book features our conversations in full along with some of our personal photos and handwritten notes We hope youll read it and get inspired to start some of your own conversations with family and friends about your lives and the world around us<sep>.

Five years ago today was a day Ill never forget After decades of protest and organizing and the determination of so many to never give up the Supreme Court declared marriage equality a reality in America As I made some comments in the Rose Garden I looked at so many young members of my staff and I noticed that they and all the people I saw on TV gathered on the steps of the Supreme Court shared the same expression on their faces joy<break><break>Later that day Michelle and I went to Charleston to remember the nine Black Americans who were murdered at Mother Emanuel church and to reflect on the grace that community showedand what it might mean if more of us found the courage to do the same And as night fell at the White House a spontaneous celebration popped up in Lafayette Parka fitting end to a momentous week<break><break>It was a week of progressof real reflection on the painful symbols of our past and continuing injustices today in the battle for the right to health care and in the struggle for full equality for every single American A week of moments that should sustain us in our longer journey to make this country we love more perfectand convince us that we can<sep>. On this day in 1865 more than two years after President Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation and two months after the end of the Civil War the enslaved people of Galveston Texas finally received word that they were free at last <break><break>We dont have to look far to see that racism and bigotry hate and intolerance are still all too alive in our world Just as the enslaved people of Galveston knew that emancipation was only the first step toward true freedom just as those who crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma knew their march was far from finished or the protesters of today continue to fight for Black lives around the countryour work remains far from done As long as people are treated differently based on nothing more than the color of their skinwe can not honestly say that our country is living up to its highest ideals <break><break>And that awareness isnt unpatriotic In fact its patriotic to believe that we can make America better Were strong enough to be selfcritical Were strong enough to look upon our imperfections and strive together to make this country we love more perfect Juneteenth has never been a celebration of victory or an acceptance of the way things are Instead its a celebration of progress Its an affirmation that despite the most painful parts of our history change is possible So no matter our color or our creed no matter where we come from or who we love today is a day to find joy in the face of sorrow and to hold the ones we love a little closer And tomorrow is a day to keep marching<sep>. Todays Supreme Court ruling protecting LGBTQ Americans from workplace discrimination is an affirmation of our countrys founding promise of equality for all Im heartened to think of all those Americans who will no longer live in fear of being fired because of who they are and who they love Its a moment decades in the making a reminder that progress can be slowbut it is always possible And its validation for all those out there speaking out and marching so that our countrys founding promise might touch even more of our people Happy Pride month everybody<sep>. As has always been true at key moments in history its going to depend on young people to go out there and rewrite what is possible So as this years graduates prepare for the next stage of what I know will be a remarkable journey I wanted to give them a few quick pieces of advice<break><break>First do what you think is right not just whats convenient or whats expected or whats easy While you have this time think about the values that matter to you the most Too many graduates who feel the pressure to immediately start running that race for success skip the step of asking themselves whats really important<break><break>Second listen to each other respect each other and use all that critical thinking youve developed from your education to help promote the truth<break><break>Finally even if it all seems broken have faith in our democracy Participateand vote Dont fall for the easy cynicism that says nothing can changeor that theres only one way to bring about change<break><break>America has always made progress because young people dared to hope Your generation is making sure thats true of our presentand our future too I know you can do itI couldnt be prouder of all of you<sep>. The young men and women of color in this country need to know something you matter Your lives matter Your dreams matter <break><break>When I look at the faces of my daughters and nephews and nieces I see limitless potential that deserves to flourish and thrive You should be able to live a life of joy and learn and make mistakes and learn from those mistakes without having to worry about what might happen when you walk to the store or go for a jog or drive down the street or look at some birds in a park So even if youre angry right now I hope youre channeling that anger toward action Because you have the power to make things better Look around at how many Americans want the same thing you do with a sense of urgency that is as powerful and transformative as anything that Ive seen in recent years <break><break>So even as we work to deliver justice for the lives of George Breonna Ahmaud Tony Sean and countless otherswe can all do our part to bring about change by protesting voting and asking for more from our elected officials Join us at Obamaorg and lets get to work<sep>. I wrote out some thoughts on how to make this moment a real turning point to bring about real changeand pulled together some resources to help young activists sustain the momentum by channeling their energy into concrete action<sep>. I want to share parts of the conversations Ive had with friends over the past couple days about the footage of George Floyd dying face down on the street under the knee of a police officer in Minnesota <break><break>The first is an email from a middleaged African American businessman <break><break>Dude I got ta tell you the George Floyd incident in Minnesota hurt I cried when I saw that video It broke me down The knee on the neck is a metaphor for how the system so cavalierly holds black folks down ignoring the cries for help People dont care Truly tragic <break><break>Another friend of mine used the powerful song that went viral from 12yearold Keedron Bryant to describe the frustrations he was feeling <break><break>The circumstances of my friend and Keedron may be different but their anguish is the same Its shared by me and millions of others <break><break>Its natural to wish for life to just get back to normal as a pandemic and economic crisis upend everything around us But we have to remember that for millions of Americans being treated differently on account of race is tragically painfully maddeningly normal whether its while dealing with the health care system or interacting with the criminal justice system or jogging down the street or just watching birds in a park <break><break>This shouldnt be normal in 2020 America It cant be normal If we want our children to grow up in a nation that lives up to its highest ideals we can and must be better <break><break>It will fall mainly on the officials of Minnesota to ensure that the circumstances surrounding George Floyds death are investigated thoroughly and that justice is ultimately done But it falls on all of us regardless of our race or station including the majority of men and women in law enforcement who take pride in doing their tough job the right way every day to work together to create a new normal in which the legacy of bigotry and unequal treatment no longer infects our institutions or our hearts<sep>. On Memorial Day we honor those who gave their all for us That takes different forms this year but its even more vital with the loss of so many veterans to COVID19 <break>The way they all lived in service to one another should be our roadmap in the months ahead<sep>. Times of crisis can bring out the best in us and Natalie Gao a medical student in Boston is a good example of that Eager to help her community she created @<user> a grassroots nonprofit organization that was formed at the beginning of March to support local restaurants and frontline healthcare workers<break><break>Off Their Plate is about the human impact of the pandemic Natalie said We exist to support those on the dual frontlines of this unprecedented crisisour healthcare workers healing the sick and our restaurant workers fueling the fight<break><break>This volunteerled organization has expanded into nine cities and continues to provide economic support to restaurant workers while also delivering free meals to folks on the frontlines Off Their Plate is making an impact not only for the healthcare workers they feed but the restaurants theyve helped support to stay in business during this time Its a terrific example of what we can do to show up for our communities<sep>. I couldnt be prouder of this years graduating high school seniorsas well as the teachers coaches and most of all parents and family whove guided you along the way Graduating is a big achievement under any circumstanceslet alone during a pandemic And some of you have had to overcome serious obstacles along the way to make it here What remains true is that your graduation marks your passage into adulthoodthe time when you begin to take charge of your own life <break><break>So heres my quick advice Be fearless Always do what you think is right And work to build a community No one does big things all by themselves When you need help Michelle and I have made it the mission of the @<user> to give young people like you the skills and support you need to be leadersand to connect you with other young people around the globe But you dont need us to tell you what to do because in so many ways youve already shown us how its done Congratulations Class of 2020keep making us proud<sep>.

Our medical professionals continue to put their lives on the line to make sure were able to get through this moment And were so grateful for all that theyre doing to keep us safe Today Ill be sharing the story of a physician on the frontlines Dr Sherene Fakhran<break><break>Dr Fakhran specializes in pulmonary and critical care and has been working at @<user> Hospital in Chicago for the last ten years These last few months have been difficult but she credits the efforts of the entire hospital the doctors nurses respiratory therapists custodians and support staff for doing their part to keep the hospital going to tend to COVID19 patients in critical need <break><break>Dr Fakhran shares more about her experience while working in the intensive care unit at Cook County Health A big part of what we do in the ICU is to communicate and build a relationship with the patients and families Speaking with families has become more challenging We also try to facilitate video calls with patients and families to help them feel connected or at times say goodbye Although I have been working with critically ill patients for many years this experience has been very emotional<break><break>What gives me the most hope is how people have come together to support in whatever way they canfrom bringing in food to making PPE for our staff All the providers in our division have also done an outstanding job staying positive supporting each other and rising up to the challenge Most importantly seeing some of our sickest patients recover and actually go home has been the best feeling of all<sep>. Theres no limit to the devotion Ive seen in teachers like these educators from @<user> Their dedication shapes the best parts of who we become I couldnt be more thankful for their work especially as they shift lessons online to keep students on track during this crisis<sep>. Ive always loved joining commencementsthe culmination of years of hard work and sacrifice Even if we cant get together in person this year Michelle and I are excited to celebrate the nationwide Class of 2020 and recognize this milestone with you and your loved ones<sep>. Just a little over a year ago around Thanksgiving I got to spend some time with the Greater Chicago @<user> Even in the relatively good times I know how difficult their work isand how dedicated they are to making sure no one in our hometown goes hungry In this crisis theyve seen a huge increase in demand for their services and become even more of a lifeline to Chicago families in need I couldnt be prouder of the way they continue their work Its selflessness like theirs that keeps kids from going hungry and makes the world a better place<sep>. Six years ago I started @<user> to address the opportunity gaps facing our boys and young men of color knowing that America could never reach its potential if they couldnt reach theirs We wanted to make sure they werent being left behind by helping them receive the mentorship resources and opportunities they deserved <break><break>These past few weeks the My Brothers Keeper Alliance has been hosting virtual town halls to checkin with community leaders looking out for communities of color that have been hit especially hard by the COVID19 pandemic I had a chance to join one of these calls and it looks like this bright kid here Avi tuned into our conversation Across the country our young peoplejust like Aviare listening in and watching how were helping out during this time Its a reminder that this work is more important than ever and that we must continue to support all our communities<sep>. On this day 50 years ago millions of people from every corner of our country joined in common cause to demand basic protections to safeguard our planet for future generations The first Earth Day helped transform the ways we interact with the world around us and it changed how we viewed our impact on the natural worldinspiring the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency and landmark legislation that protected the air we breathe the water we drank and the animals that lived alongside us <break><break>Today were reminded more than ever of the role we playand the responsibility of our governmentto ensure that we do not pass a world beyond repair on to our children And that starts by not denying the evidence presented by scientists and climate activists around climate change We must demand more from our government return to the Paris Agreement and work to lead the world in reducing the pollution that continues to cause climate change And science is telling us to go much furtherwe must continue to accelerate progress on bold new green initiatives that make our economy a clean energy innovator <break><break>When I think of the world I want to see in the future for my daughtersand the children across the worldIm reminded that there is so much more we need to do to take care of the one planet weve got and its up to all of us to demand and lead that change,M,barackobama

I LOVE THIS Thank you my @<user> family for posting this Swann the renegade @<user> @<user><sep>. Dear Kobe<break>I wish that this letter had gotten to you while you were still on this earth with us Im quite sure that we wouldve been friends While we only got to shake hands a half dozen times over the last 20 years there was never a moment that I walked away from you not feeling inspired You were 19 and I was 18 when we first met I remember thinking Whoa this guy is only four months older than me I better get on it<break>I heard about an interview that you did that prompted me write this When asked how you explain the complexity of death to your kids you simply said that you told them or to the effect of That when a person dies they become made of stars Monday morning after your horrible crash my little 25 yr old giggling daughter picked THIS shirt out of all of her shirts to wearThis tiny little girl in this tiny little shirt just rocked me and tears just streamed from my eyes <break>While no man is perfect Im not pretending to know your personal life I respectfully only know the hardworking man who inspired millions and millions of us A man that was proud of his family and cherished them Your passion to invest in youth is what always struck me as such a powerful smart courageous element of your life A gift to the worldTo us all None of us can comprehend the unimaginable pain sadness that your beautiful wife and family are experiencing right now This has hit and rocked our households in a way that I could have never thought The sudden violent loss of such an inspiring athlete business man philanthropist husband and father his young child and others has shaken us to our coresThis terrible event has not slapped us all in the face but rather punched us so very hard in the gut A major reality that we forget in our busy and noisy livesThat life is EXTREMELY fragile and can be taken away at any momentIt is our duty to love those around us and leave this planet better than when we came into it We aim to send nothing but the most powerful and positive energy to your family Rest In Peace Kobe with your little one and friends With immense gratitude and appreciation<break>Ian Somerhalder<sep>.

You can tell how relatively ancient this tie is by the old Reiss label their corporate logo is very different now When I was young so much younger than today I lived in Draycott Place Chelsea just off the Kings Road I became enamoured of the Reiss store there and especially its wonderful jumpers I still have most of them It frightened me how much they cost I had just left university and was starting out but even though I couldnt afford it I just wasnt able to stop myself from splurging on things Reiss<break>The company was founded by David Reiss in Bishopsgate not far from Liverpool Street Station in 1971 and produced exclusively menswear mostly suits While on the subject of the garment business I love the words suitings trouserings and shirtings which refer I think not to the items themselves but to the fabrics used to make them up No one says pantings or vestings so far as I know which is a shame but there we are Anyway @<user> added womenswear and grew and grew and has done especially well lately You see outlets in airports and shopping centres everywhere these days theyve even got a branch in Greenwich Village NY apparently They are justly proud of their 2019 designs being showcased on the largest digital screen in Europe in Piccadilly Circus<break><break>The tie hasnt been well kept for which I apologise Yellow is perhaps my favourite colour all in all but I have been surprised by how the great majority of the ties I own seem to be red or mixtures of red So heres a yellow # fryties submission sparsely dotted with comely little flowers It will always make me think of Chelsea punks in mohicans the Queens Head in Tryon St a warm and friendly little gay pub and those original Sloane Rangers in the heady days of Lady Di Dire Straits and the Rubiks Cube<sep>. Some have asked for a glimpse of my good old Bacon and Egg and here it is The tie of the Marylebone Cricket Club Plenty of you are already snorting yawning fidgeting sneering or shaking your head in bewilderment But others will know whereof I speak A 29 year waiting list for membership gives you some idea that weird and preposterous as it may seem to many membership of the MCC is certainly highly prized It gives one access to parts of Lords Cricket Ground @<user> that are as hallowed as religious shrines The Long Room the Committee Room story at the foot of this text the little eyries and secret places from which to watch the cricket Pavilioned in splendour and girded with praise as the old hymn has it<break><break>I am old enough to know that you can not make someone like cricket any more than you can make them like Wagner We lovers of these things are used to having to apologise and bow our heads while we are told how boring such pursuits are Well they each in their own way give me deeper and more abiding pleasure than most things in life and if that makes me a sucker or a poseur or something else unacceptable well so be it I think that with the MCC bacon and egg tie unlike the Garrick Clubs cucumber and salmon see the post from a month or so back it is rather frowned upon to wear it anywhere other than at Lords To wear it to a match at the Oval or Headingley for example would surely be the height of bad form Members can get the tie at the MCC shop in the Lords grounds but Dege Skinner @<user> are one of the few family owned Savile Row tailors left so worth supporting<break><break>Swipe left for a picture of me achieving a lifetimes ambition ringing the bell to start play on the day of a Lords test Jim Swanton veteran cricket writer once came out of the Committee Room saying in shocked tones Theres a WOMAN in there Yes Jim Its the Queen shes visiting Long pause and then one word from Jim Nevertheless Happily that sort of thing has changed<sep>. I have taken a Liberty again This one turned up just the other day in an old suitcase where it had no business to be hidden away I talk about Libertys the Regent Street store in an earlier post <break>Arthur Liberty like so many retailers and entrepreneurs in the field of the decorative arts in the 19th century was hugely inspired by two major movements in art and design In the high Victorian era Japanese culture became all the rage in Britain inspiring Gilbert and Sullivans operetta The Mikado as well as a great deal of wallpaper fabrics and miscellaneous artefacts As trade between Europe and Japan flourished the arrival of woodblock prints by practitioners like Hokusai Kunisada and Hiroshige had a transformative effect on the work of Western artists Whistler Degas ToulouseLautrec and most notably perhaps Vincent Van Gogh were all avid collectors of Japanese prints<break><break>The other great artistic energy of the time derived from John Ruskin William Morris and the Arts and Crafts movement which morphed with the help of continental European influences into the flowing lines of Art Nouveau detractors dismissed it as the Noodle Style In the work of decadent artists like Aubrey Beardsley the two influences came triumphantly together And you might say in a more every day manner they came together in the famous Liberty Prints too<break><break>The sumptuously fluid loveliness of this very Art Nouveau tie appeals to me in ways I cant quite explain It takes me back to the childhood drooling for raspberry cordials always more thrilling in prospect and appearance than reality Its almost a kind of longing<break><break>Ive included a very silly picture of me in a bottle green frogged smoking jacket wearing the tie swipe left for Pic 2 The tie has long been such a favourite and makes a fitting FIFTIETH to have presented to you in this # fryties series How time flies Im embarrassed how these 50 havent even scratched the surface of the collection Theyre just the tip of the tieberg<sep>. Well at some point I had to present you with this zigzag Armani tie You can see how loved it is by the dilapidated state of the fat end Used for polishing spectacles and collecting dropped food the poor thing looks ready to curl up and die Which is a shame because this snazzy design speaks to my very deeps It might remind you of the Royal Artillery regimental tie which has jagged red lines like that but sharper and acuter angles I think and on a field of midnight blue rather than this # fryties offerings mushroomy beige<break><break>In the 1980s Giorgio Armani became the hippest hottest and happeningest of all the designers in the world It was the era of unstructured jackets raglan sleeves linen shirts and spacious trousers for the men and big hair and padded shoulders for the women Eric Clapton fresh from rehab popularised the tasteful subdued and loose fitting Armani look Emporio Armani Armani Jeans Armani Junior Armani sunglasses Armani loafers Armani bags Armani hotels the man is said to have a net worth substantially north of six and half billion of your earth dollars<break><break>I think its true to say that this tie is the only Armani object Ive ever owned Not out of dislike for the brand but because the company doesnt really offer the kind of clobber thats made for the likes of me Armani looks fine on other people Snakehipped and waspwaisted types look especially good in it but it just wont sit right on Stephens Which is perfectly ok by me so long as I have this dear old tie<sep>.
