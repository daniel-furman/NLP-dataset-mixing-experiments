8,Tim @<user> thanks for hosting us for this It was truly a blast # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty <url><sep>. But first Ill make time for the Nevermind # TimsListeningParty because @<user> is one of my biggest influences and that is one of my favorite albums of all time Its an honor to be doing this the same day as them<sep>. Wow its been so long since I remembered some of these songsthis was so fun you guys now time to get back into the studio and keep moving on the newest stuff # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty<sep>. I still write with Luisfer to this day and its one of the times when I feel the most free Just him me and an acoustic guitar # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty <url><sep>. Moody guitars slides the lyrics of that song also makes use of a lot of hyperbole I guess Im a hyperbolic person when it comes to love Or in general Ha # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty<sep>. Que Me Quedes Tu was a love song I did with Luisfer Ochoa my longtime collaborator from Pies Descalzos to today That song very much has the sound of what Luisfer and I do together # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty <url><sep>. I was using the writing device of personification but in the opposite way instead of making an object or an animal into a person I did the contrary # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty<sep>. Poem to a Horsethis was me at the height of poetic hyperbole Essentially I was comparing a love interest to a horsewho couldnt appreciate what he had before him # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty <url><sep>. Its a song that has stood the test of time really wellI didnt perform it on this last tour but I might have to bring it back Its so nice to hear it again # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty <url><sep>. Te Dejo Madrid is one of the few Spanishlanguage songs from Laundry Serviceand its still one of the most fun to perform In Madrid especially # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty<sep>. @ BrendanDrums has been with me for almost my entire career and we still do things together like Girl Like Me but this is one of the first we did just me and him # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty <url><sep>. Fool is a song that I wrote with my drummer @<user> # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty <url><sep>. That tour the Tour of the Mongoose was my biggest tour yet and we had so much fun It was incredible for me to be able to perform to so many people in countries Id never even been to before # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty <url><sep>. Ready For The Good Times was one of the most fun for me to perform on tourthere was a dance that went with it that I really enjoyed # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty <url><sep>. The One was the last single off of Laundry Service The power ballad Shakira lol # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty<sep>. Rules was the song where I first performed playing drums on tour I had played drums before but that was the first song where I played them onstage # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty<sep>. It was one of the only times I actually listened to the label about which song to put out and when He convinced me # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty<sep>. When I played my music for the label Tommy Mottola went crazy for that song I wanted Objection to be the first single but I was totally wrongand he was totally right # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty <url><sep>. I was in a moment where I was in love with Latin folkloric music and I wanted something that honored that # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty<sep>. Whenever came out of me wanting to do a song with Andean sounds and instruments like the pan flute and the bombo leguero # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty <url><sep>. I was a huge fan of Herb but after that shoot I dont think he was a huge fan of mine because I took 7 hours in hair and makeup before shootingI was nervous ok # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty<sep>. Underneath was another of my first songs written in Englishwe did the video with Herb Ritts an iconic photographer whose black and white images I really loved and who I was dying to work with # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty <url><sep>. I wanted to do a tango because at the time I was dating an Argentinian and was learning the dance and was immersed in the Argentine culture # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty<sep>. Objection was the very first song I wrote in English on a mattress in the bedroom of my Miami apartment with a thesaurus in hand when I could barely speak the language # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty <url><sep>. Hola a todos Excited to sit down and listen to # LaundryService20 with you on its 20th birthdayits been a long time since I heard this album from top to bottom thanks @ TimBurgess @<user> for hosting OK lets all press play now # TimsListeningParty <url><sep>.

Super cuteeeeeee <url><sep>. Youre now on that list <url><sep>. Then cool I thought he was a girl for the last 5 months so I really dont think it makes a difference <url><sep>. Iam getting another rabbit tho but we are adopting one and Smokey will pick based on who he gets along with so Hopefully he doesnt like the ugly girls<sep>. @<user> No but you just seem like the fun police thats all<sep>. Not you policing where I do my day dreaming for a fake dog Im never buying lmao <url><sep>. Am I the only person who fully looks at puppies online knowing they 10000 have no intention of buying one Every other day It hits 11pm and BOOM I got ta window shop for puppies<sep>. @<user> The cute ones I dont wan na be no sea hag Hahaha<sep>. @<user> And I pulled it up in 5 seconds Conspiracy about our frog gills ended Although I do wan na be a mermaid just like everyone else<sep>. I love you guys so much but please read the paper hiccups arent from us having hills and they never concluded that Always READ the source paper guys <url><sep>. Why Is evolution a scary subject or Is it that it comes from this original paper listing it as one of many hypothesis reasons given and then the internet used it for click bait because they know you wont actually read and fishes are cool Here it is httpstcoTUylAfTCcV <url><sep>. Told you your shits broken <url> <url><sep>. @<user> Naur<sep>. Your internet is broken again <url><sep>. Ive had the hiccups for 57 years<sep>. @<user> @<user> @<user> @<user> @<user> Thankyou for saying this Im happy to see Im not the only one who thinks its overstepping personal boundaries<sep>. @<user> @<user> @<user> @<user> Exactly Thankyou for understanding<sep>. @<user> @<user> Love you<sep>. I love seeing all the kids together <url><sep>. How many of you are actually deep frying a full turkey tho I<sep>. My moms coming to visit tomorrow amp im so excited for her to see how big onyx is now She hasnt been able to visit since his bday<sep>. Its a rabbit can you relax <url><sep>. Turns out our rabbit is actually a boy Luckily Smokey works as a name either way<sep>. Karmas a bitch Lmao<sep>. This is extremely cute <url><sep>. @<user> Are you in a mask If so you should feel a lot less anxiety Just keep your mask on and make sure to clean your hands when you exit<sep>. Haha thats how I felt when I wrote over this beat I was like am I about to go full yee haw on this beat <url><sep>. I dont think so Ive never heard of anyone paying for them regardless of origin <url><sep>. Its free in the USA <url><sep>. Iam an immigrant we have to have a long list of vaccinations before being granted a green card Doesnt matter if you already them they do a blood test and if your antibodies are too low for certain vaccines you have to redo them so Im pretty familiar with the concept <url><sep>. with that said I will keep being vaccinated for Covid as long as its actively being spread in my community because thats the best way I can help stop it spreading and you should too<sep>. Lets get into that depends how active Covid is in cases example Measles vaccineyou need a shot every 10 years to remain effective but most ppl dont go back because its not something in the community being spread actively therefore not high on your list of shit to do <url><sep>. If you have your vaccination more than 6 months ago you should book an appointment for a booster shot to make sure you still have enough antibodies in your system for it to be effective <url><sep>. If youve been vaccinated as time passes your immunity declines and youll need a booster vaccination to restore the antibodies in your body to a level that gives you real protection I was vaccinated early April so I just got my booster shot yesterday <url><sep>. Its been more than 24hrs now and Im not feeling anything so I think Im in the clear <url><sep>. Thankyou but I dont feel bad Lol <url><sep>. I said Id give an update about getting the booster shot so here it is Nothing happened besides my arm being a bit sore I feel totally normal<sep>. @<user> Im feeling normal still but lets see how it goes when I wake up Honestly Id be surprised if I have any side effects because it takes ALOT for me to be run down<sep>. I dont think theres a person alive on this planet happier than Britney Spears today amp the thought of that really makes me smile<sep>. Just got my booster shot<sep>. I definitely will but all my decorations wont be here yet Once its 100 done Ill share with you guys <url><sep>. Im putting up my Christmas tree tomorrow Fuck it<sep>. Thankyou <url><sep>. Infinite fuck NOoooooOoo lol <url><sep>. Pink lady is my favorite apple <url><sep>. If it was before 2005 thats fine <url>,0

44,Thanks so much to everybody for watching the first season of the iCarly revival You guys are the best and we cant wait for you to see Season 2<sep>. Has anybody ever been told I love you by two guys at the same time I definitely havent Carly handled it better than I probably wouldve # iCarlyFinale<sep>. I love the scene with Spencer and Millicent investing in Freddies app Millicent has a hard shell but she definitely loves Freddie and you always see it when it really counts # iCarlyFinale<sep>. @<user> and I had fun dressing up and wearing flower crowns when we sit on a suitcase and talk about our complicated love lives We decided to do valley girl voices at the end of the scene for Theyre so cute Theyre best friends So cute<sep>. For the treehouse scene where it falls out of the tree during the storm our crew actually built a set that was like a ride at an amusement park A remote controlled the entire set and it flew from side to side on a spring # iCarlyFinale<sep>. We got to make smores and eat them in between takes around the campfire Ive never actually been camping and it was my first time making smores # iCarlyFinale<sep>. George the Bra that tells Ghost Stories was one of my favorite old skits from the original iCarly so I was excited the writers had Beau mention it during the campfire scene # iCarlyFinale<sep>. I think its so cute watching Spencer and Millicent work together in secret to try to help Freddie sell his app # iCarlyFinale<sep>. When Beau offers Carly coke with lime the writers put that in because everyone knows how much I love drinking coke in real life # iCarlyFinale<sep>. Every time @<user> said the line helluva Bidet I couldnt not laugh # iCarlyFinale<sep>. I actually loved the luxury treehouse that Beau gets to stay in at Webicon I wish I could stay in one in real life # iCarlyFinale<sep>. @<user> and I had a lotta fun picking up the smallest twigs and really playing up having no idea how to camp or survive in the wilderness during the scene with the compass<sep>. I actually ate a few of the marshmallows off of Dutchs performance dress # iCarlyFinale<sep>. We switched the opening titles back to the full version of the theme song for the # iCarlyFinale and I asked if we could add in the old shot from the original title sequence where Carly throws her blue cowboy hat in the air<sep>. During the opening scene where the group is packing to go to Webicon I kept messing up the everybody hands in moment I dont think Id ever been in charge of a group huddle before and it was hard to get the timing right<sep>.

142,This Veterans Day I want to share Tom Voutsoss story He served in the US Marine Corps and has continued to live a life dedicated to public service Through @<user> hes helping hardworking folks buy their own home <url><sep>. To every veteran and their family we thank you for your service and sacrifice to our country <url><sep>. @ SpeakerPelosi and these members of Congress are making it clear that the United States is back and will continue to lead the way on climate change We would not have met our Paris goals without them and now theyre working to do even more <url><sep>. Young people have more at stake in the fight against climate change than anyone else I had a chance to talk with some young people who are helping lead the fight and could not be more impressed by their courage creativity and persistence They give me hope <url><sep>. If you care about climate change @<user> new book Speed amp Scale An Action Plan for Solving Our Climate Crisis Now offers concrete steps that we can all take to make a difference <url><sep>. Thats why if were going to act on the scale thats required climate change cant be seen as another opportunity to score political points We need everybody And young people in particular have an opportunity to make a real difference<sep>. But once again progress is partial Most nations have failed to be as ambitious as they need to be and the escalation of ambition that we anticipated in Paris six years ago has not been uniformly realized<sep>. The good news is that countries around the world recognize this is a decisive decade if we want to avoid a climate disaster and are setting important goals for 2030 Theyve also promised to help countries move away from fossil fuels and deal with the effects of climate change<sep>. I spoke at COP26 in Glasgow about whats happened in the six years since the Paris Agreement and how much further we still need to go to control climate changehttpstcoan9xxwrOQC<sep>. Weve done some important work since the Paris Agreement was signed six year ago but were still nowhere near where we need to be on climate Watch live from # COP26in Glasgow as I talk about the steps we can take to combat climate changehttpstcofpoGbnNehm<sep>. Five years ago the Paris Agreement went into effect Paris provided an important framework in the fight against climate change but it wasnt enough Thats why Ill be speaking in Glasgow on Monday about the road ahead and what young people in particular can do to help <url><sep>. Visit <url> to find your polling location And if you have any questions call the voter hotline at 8333368683<sep>. Today is Election Day and so much of what we care about is on the ballotfrom access to health care to bringing our economy back from COVID19 to combating climate change We need everybody going out to vote So make a plan to vote and make your voice heard<sep>. Signing the Paris Agreement to fight climate change was one of my proudest moments in office But it was always a foundation to build on As world leaders gather for COP26 I shared some reflections on the road to Paris and the young activists who are pushing us further <url><sep>. In a country as large and diverse as ours progress can often feel frustrating and slow with small victories accompanied by frequent setbacks But once in a while its still possible to take a giant leap forward Thats what the Build Back Better framework represents <url><sep>. Climate change isnt a distant environmental issueits already having an immediate impact on our lives including huge national security implications as more communities come under stresshttpstcowLnJgynwCs<sep>. When you look at the history of big social movements theyre usually started and sustained by young people who put in the work to make it happen As we look to COP26 Im inspired by the young people using their voices in the fight against climate change <url><sep>. It was great to be back in New Jersey Theres too much at stake in this election to sit it out Lets keep New Jersey moving forward by reelecting @<user> and Democrats up and down the ballot Make a plan to vote earlyand get everyone you know to do the same <url><sep>. Virginians delivered for me twice and now Im asking them to do it again by electing @<user> as their next governor Every bit of progress in Virginia is at stake in this electionand theres no time to waste Make a plan to vote early at <url> <url><sep>. Some of the most important changes often start in state legislatures Thats why Im proud to support these candidates for the Virginia state legislature I hope youll join me and the @<user> in giving them your vote <url><sep>. Glad I had a chance to talk with our new champs I really am proud of this team and their work this season <url><sep>. At a time when voting rights are being rolled back the Freedom to Vote Act would strengthen our democracy and give more Americans a voice Thats why the Senate should do the right thing and protect what so many generations fought so hard to secure<sep>. It was great speaking with the @<user> Advisory Council and hearing more about the work theyre doing to make a difference in the lives of boys and young men of color across the country <url><sep>. General Colin Powell understood what was best in this country and tried to bring his own life career and public statements in line with that ideal Michelle and I will always look to him as an example of what Americaand Americanscan and should be <url><sep>. Congratsto our new WNBA champs @<user> I couldnt be prouder of this team they worked hard for this moment and have made our city proud <url><sep>. Today we lost an icon with the passing of Timuel Black Over his 102 years Tim was many things a veteran historian author educator civil rights leader and humanitarian Michelle and I send our thoughts to his family and everyone who loved him <url><sep>. I was deeply saddened to learn about the passing of General Ray Odierno after a battle with cancer He devoted his life to serving this country and for that I will always be grateful Michelle and I send our thoughts to his wife Linda and their children <url><sep>. Congratulations to Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov This award is a tribute to their extraordinary courage and the enduring value of factbased journalism and freedom of expression which is under threat in far too many places today <url><sep>. And of course Im excited for my @<user> to be back in the playoffs Its going to be hard to top a walkoff home run on the Field of Dreams but if any team can do it its this one Go Sox <url><sep>. Its always good to be from Chicago but this year is especially sweet Congratulations to the @<user> for making it to the WNBA finals and to the legend @<user> for making all of us proud Well be rooting for you <url><sep>. If we dont stand up for democracy well see this type of gerrymandering happen in even more states Its why @<user> is fighting for # FairMaps And its why the Senate must pass the Freedom to Vote Act to protect our communities from partisan gerrymandering<sep>. And in Georgia Republicans released a congressional map that decreases the voting power of communities of color including African Americans in a historically Black district and ignores how the state has changed<sep>. In Texas for example Republicans recently passed a law making voting harder especially for people of color Now theyre advancing a new congressional map thats tilted in their favor and doesnt reflect the states growth <url><sep>. Right now state legislatures across the country are setting new boundaries for state legislative and congressional districts And in many states Republicans are drawing maps that allow them to hold onto power<sep>. Our latest production from Higher Ground Ada Twist Scientist is now on Netflix Based on the book series the show will continue the work we started at the White House Science Fair We hope it inspires more young people to discover science and use their imagination to create <url><sep>. Happy anniversary Miche Over the past 29 years Ive loved watching the world get to know you not just as a daughter of the South Side but as a mother lawyer executive author First Lady and my best friend I cant imagine life without you <url><sep>. Happy 97th birthday President Carter Thank you for the extraordinary example of lifelong service that youve set for all of us<sep>. Today we officially broke ground on the Obama Presidential Center on the South Side of Chicago Michelle and I cant imagine a better investment in the city we love and generations of young leaders who will help create change <url><sep>. Michelle and I couldnt be more excited to officially <break> ground on the Obama Presidential Center on the South Side of Chicago Tune in livehttpstcoO4VvzEgwIx<sep>. Michelle and I had fun surprising some of the hardworking women from the Chicago Women of Trades Were grateful for the work theyre doingnot only to build the Obama Presidential Center but also to make it easier for more people to follow their example <url><sep>. It was great meeting our newest class of @<user> Scholars at @<user> Young leaders like them are the source of my hope and I believe they will power a brighter future for all of us <url><sep>. Chicago will always be an important place to @<user> and me which is why were excited to celebrate the virtual ground<break>ing for the Obama Presidential Center in Chicagonext weekIts been a long time coming and we cant wait to see this project come to life <url><sep>. If we want to give our children and grandchildren a brighter future the wealthiest Americans and large corporations must pay their fair share in taxes <url><sep>. The repeal of Dont Ask Dont Tell allowed these two Marines to be true to themselves while serving in our military Listen to their story <url><sep>. Ten years ago today we repealed Dont Ask Dont Tell Today our military is stronger and our country is safer because patriotic Americans no longer have to live a lie in order to defend the country they love <url><sep>. Wishing my friend @<user> the best in Canadas upcoming election Justin has been an effective leader and strong voice for democratic values and Im proud of the work we did together<sep>. The Freedom to Vote Act just introduced in the Senate would strengthen our democracy by making it easier for people to vote and harder for politicians and special interests to drown out the voices of ordinary Americans I support it and every Senator should do the same<sep>. Many of the refugees fleeing Afghanistan stood by America and risked everything for a chance at a better life With the launch of <url> we can support our new Afghan neighbors and reaffirm our common humanity I hope youll join us <url><sep>. Today we honor the nearly 3000 men women and children who died on September 11 2001 and the heroes who have always run towards danger to do whats right Lets never forget that day and lets never take them for granted <url><sep>. It was great speaking with @<user> Murthy and the COVID19 Community Corps volunteers across the country whove been spending their time and energy encouraging their communities to get vaccinated Their work is making a difference and will help us end this pandemic <url><sep>. California Youve got a big choice to make by September 14 and everything is on the line Your vote could be the difference between protecting our kids or putting them at risk helping Californians recover or taking us backwards Vote no on the Republican recall<sep>. Great memories of an important day 31 million people now have health insuranceand the peace of mind that comes with itthanks to the Affordable Care Act Now @<user> is committed to making it even stronger through his Build Back Better plan <url><sep>. The pandemic has devastated communities everywhere But the young leaders in our newest class of @<user> Scholars studying at @<user> and @<user> give me hope for a better future Congratulations Scholars <url><sep>. Labor Day is about honoring folks like Maurice Harrisa devoted husband and father of five who has spent his career working in the trades in Chicago Hell soon help build our Obama Presidential Center Heres his incredible story <url><sep>. This Labor Day lets honor all the working men and women who make this country what it isand the American labor movement that has helped protect them especially during this pandemic<sep>. Michelle and I are thinking of everyone affected by Hurricane Ida and were grateful to the first responders doing heroic work Here are some ways to support those in need <url><sep>. May God bless the memory of those we lost and protect those who remain in harms way<sep>. Our hearts go out to the families who lost a loved one and to everyone continuing the mission in Kabul Were also thinking of the families of the Afghans who died many of whom stood by America and were willing to risk everything for a chance at a better life<sep>. As president nothing was more painful than grieving with the loved ones of Americans who gave their lives serving our country As President Biden said these service members are heroes who have been engaged in a dangerous selfless mission to save the lives of others<sep>. Like so many of you Michelle and I were heartbroken to hear about the terrorist attack outside the Kabul airport that killed and wounded so many US service members as well as Afghan men women and children<sep>. Yesterday the House passed the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act that will help Americans everywhere make their voices heard Now the Senate needs to follow the Houses lead Call your Senators and ask them to do the right thing Our democracy is on the line <url><sep>. The Olympics may be over but the @<user> are just getting started Many of the athletes on @<user> have traveled amazing journeys to reach the top of their sport and Ill be cheering them on Hope you will too <url>,1

148,To tackle the biggest global health challenges all countries must have access to vaccines and other health innovations This 150M commitment from the foundation and @<user> will help low and middleincome countries get the essential supplies they need <url><sep>. I recently met with 36 remarkable graduate students who made me more optimistic than ever that we can # EndMalaria <url><sep>.

Im proud that @<user> Energy is a part of the First Movers Coalition Our efforts with @<user> @<user> and other partners will help to scale the clean technologies that will become the foundation of our netzero future <url><sep>. Demand for syringes has skyrocketed to deliver the COVID19 vaccines Increasing production of autodisable syringes will help ensure low and middleincome countries have the tools they need to deliver routine and COVID vaccines <url><sep>. Im grateful for the leadership of our @<user> Energy Catalyst public and private sector partners By taking coordinated courageous climate action we can lower Green Premiums and deploy the clean technologies that will help us reach net zero <url><sep>.

Encouraged to discuss with PM @<user> on the sidelines of # COP26 the potential of further investments in science innovation and transformative agriculture RampD as an important foundation for mitigating impact of climate change on small landowning farmers @<user> @<user> <url><sep>. One of my top priorities here at # COP26 is making sure that the world prioritizes scaling clean technology innovation Here is the message I delivered to world leaders earlier today <url><sep>. In addition to investments in reducing emissions to slow climate change we need to help those already impacted by climate change adapt <url><sep>. By bringing the world together at # COP26 we can find more ways to accelerate the development and adoption of the clean technologies we need to reach netzero emissions <url><sep>. At this years UN Climate Conference innovation will take center stage and Im optimistic about the road ahead <url><sep>. I hope Congress passes the Build Back Better Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act fast We cant wait another moment <url><sep>. Good to see this commitment by @<user> to help ensure from the outset that molnupiravir a potential treatment for COVID19 will be available to many more nations <url><sep>.

This # WorldPolioDay you can support Shumaila and other polio workers by donating to @<user> fight against polio Our foundation is giving a 2to1 match to every donation Learn more <url><sep>.

The world is so close to ending polio thanks to heroes like Shumaila Rehmani <url> # WorldPolioDay <url><sep>. Our funding is only part of the solution More donors will need to step up to make sure molnupiravir is available to all as quickly as possible<sep>. Everyone deserves equitable access to healthcare Thats why we engaged partners like @<user> and @<user> to find more affordable safe materials that generic manufacturers can use to produce medicines at a lower cost<sep>. Weve done this before In 2017 the @<user> worked with partners and generic suppliers to bring improved HIV therapies to more than 18 million people in lowerincome countries<sep>.

I wrote about two ways to achieve vaccine equity in the future If the world makes the right investments and decisions now we can make things better next time And maybe even make sure there is no next time at all <url><sep>. Still the disparities in access to the COVID19 vaccine are shocking and unjust Only 2 percent of people in lowincome countries have received any COVID19 vaccines And the gap may be getting even larger as richworld governments buy up extra doses to serve as booster shots<sep>. Inequity in health is not new Each year more than 5 million childrenalmost entirely in low and middleincome countriesdie before their fifth birthday from mostly preventable diseases Reducing this gap has been the Gates Foundations top priority for more than 20 years<sep>. The pandemic has worsened inequities But its also shown the world whats possible when we come together Read why theres reason to be optimistic in our 2021 Goalkeepers Report <url><sep>.

Irelands Greatest Public House Has just become the Double Greatest Congrats to the team Incredible Introducing Wagyu at @<user> <url><sep>. Thank you Sir a lovely sequence of my art Onwards we go on this journey of Martial Arts and life <url><sep>. @<user> Hahaha ye but thats 8 shots not 1 8 shots is cool The Octagon<sep>.

Binny and his team in Chicago are just incredible people What a team @<user> Tell them I said whats up <url><sep>. @<user> Not everyone is Sir lol Be kind<sep>. Whiskey is not to be shot You do not do shots of Whiskey It is to be poured Savored And enjoyed fully The Proper way You can drink straight or my personal favorite on the rocks but never shots Whats the hurry Savor it all life is beautifu <url><sep>. For sure this is true The smoothness of my whiskey makes it this way But I am telling you One single cube of ice Just one It will work magic in opening up the liquid for you to fully experience and enjoy all the beautiful notes of Proper Whiskey Take it all in and Savor <url><sep>. @<user> Same thing for sure Slight dilution is needed to open the flavor I just prefer the ice cube tho Its a safer bet Slower release of the dilution plus it is nice and colder Straight water is a dangerous game to play You dilute to much and its not a good time lol<sep>. I appreciate this thank you Proper Twelve has always done amazing in blind taste tests I was speaking on this the other day Depending who the person is bias one way or the other can take over honest opinion I am a big fan of and always confident in blind taste testing <url><sep>. My whiskey is the smoothest on the market bar none But I still do not recommend to drink fully straight Onetwo cubes of ice is perfect The ice opens the flavor inside the glass Think of the liquid as a fist in the barrel you need slight dilution to open it Slight now <url><sep>. I do indeed Forged in Dublin @<user> <url> <url><sep>. @<user> Get the crew and jump a flight Aaron The Scots are always welcome<sep>.

His head was sorer my leg was sorer I feel good on that Not to say his leg wasnt busted either tho I had that thigh well minced I feel its just simply not settled yet Is the fairest response I can give <url><sep>. In my last camp Id a severely damaged left leg Many of my sessions consisted of starting in open guard bottom And staying there Full rounds remaining on bottom I was beating people up until they backed away from me It then translated to the fight True story @<user> <url><sep>.

fun<sep>. @<user> i have certainly been<sep>. @<user> yes we filmed for two whole days so i think it could have easily been an hour show<sep>. @<user> i thought it was an unrealistic dream so i went to law school and then got caught up in the whole internet thing<sep>. @<user> to be fair i had only seen phils house and he thought wed get merked wearing skinny jeans if we went out<sep>. @<user> im still in the oven<sep>. @<user> and to think they werent interested back then<sep>. @<user> like everything was very small because i am now very long<sep>. @<user> are you saying my teen years of loitering behind infrastructure isnt exciting<sep>. @<user> it was the hottest day of the year in rossendale which made it beautiful and sweaty<sep>. @<user> there was some nice cement and grass<sep>.

craps<sep>. @<user> definitely too many expectations for midday what are we supposed to have achieved<sep>. im not really a morning person but also not a night person so i guess im just trying to say im always useless and tired<sep>. @<user> this is all just one big intervention for me<sep>. @<user> yes whatever information they are getting from me will be totally useless and probably terrifying<sep>. @<user> i will cause everyone to deactivate and we will have world peace<sep>. @<user> you would be disturbed by how utterly offline some of these people are maybe thats what draws me to them<sep>. @<user> if you arent calling out grandma whats the point<sep>. @<user> they used to punch me and now i want them step on my neck<sep>. @<user> scared or hopeful im not sure<sep>. the only reason i havent deactivated facebook is to stalk school friends that i fantasise about reuniting and hooking up with despite the fact they have full lives and havent thought about me in years so

pressure<sep>. you souldnt have to wait until you are in a crisis to get helpplease add your name to this open letter to @<user> for the government to prioritise mental health in the upcoming spending review it would literally save lives <url> <url><sep>. @<user> waiting for dawn of chromatica yellow flannel<sep>. @<user> watching 10 streamers in separate tabs and pretending im having a party<sep>.

Despus de haberlo hablado con el equipo y familia se ha tomado esta decisin y creo que es el camino a seguir para intentar recuperarme y recuperarme bienEs un ao que me he perdido cosas que me importan mucho como Wimbledon como son las Olimpiadas<sep>.

Partidazo de Espaa hoy Enhorabuena chicos y fuerza para los cuartos de final Vamossssss # Espaa # Eurocopa2021 # vamos @<user><sep>. <url><sep>. The Olympic Games always meant a lot and they were always a priority as a Sports person I found the spirit that every sports person in the world wants to live I personally had the chance to live 3 of them and had the honor to be the flag bearer for my country<sep>. I want to send a special message to my fans around the world to those in the United Kingdom and Japan in particular<sep>. Sport prevention of any kind of excess in my body is a very important factor at this stage of my career in order to try to keep fighting for the highest level of competition and titles<sep>. The fact that there has only been 2 weeks between RG and Wimbledon didnt make it easier on my body to recuperate after the always demanding clay court season They have been two months of great effort and the decision I take is focused looking at the mid and long term<sep>. The goal is to prolong my career and continue to do what makes me happy that is to compete at the highest level and keep fighting for those professional and personal goals at he maximum level of competition<sep>. Hi all I have decided not to participate at this years Championships at Wimbledon and the Olympic Games in Tokyo Its never an easy decision to take but after listening to my body and discuss it with my team I understand that it is the right decision<sep>. Los JJOO han significado mucho en mi carrera y siempre fueron una prioridad como deportista encontr el ambiente que todo deportista quiere sentir al menos una vez y personalmente tuve la suerte de vivirlos intensamente en tres ocasiones y ademas ser el abanderado de mi pas<sep>. En estos momentos de mi carrera como deportista una parte importante es la prevencin de cualquier tipo de excesos en mi cuerpo que pudieran impedir seguir luchando en el medio y largo plazo por los ttulos<sep>. El hecho de que haya solo dos semanas entre Roland Garros y Wimbledon este ao no ha ayudado a que mi cuerpo pueda recuperar de la siempre exigente temporada de tierra batida Han sido dos meses de un gran esfuerzo y la decisin que tomo va enfocada al medio y largo plazo<sep>. Es una decisin que nunca resulta fcil de tomar Tras escuchar mi cuerpo y hablar con mi equipo entiendo que es la decisin acertada con el objetivo de alargar mi carrera deportiva y seguir haciendo lo que me hace feliz competir al mximo nivel y seguir luchando<sep>. Hola a todos Quiero comunicaros que he decidido no participar en la prxima edicin de Wimbledon que se disputar del 28 de junio al 11 de julio Tampoco jugar los Juegos Olmpicos previstos finalmente del 24 al 30 de julio<sep>. Very excited to experience the Kia # EV6 The design is really inspiring and I think lots of you will like itMuy contento con probar el Kia # EV6 El diseo es verdaderamente inspirador y creo que os gustar # Kia # MovementThatInspires # KiaEV6 <url><sep>.

231,If we put the # Gospel at the centre and bear witness to it with fraternal love we will be able to look to the future with hope whatever the tempests great or small we may experience today<sep>. It is my hope and prayer that each of you can joyfully say With Jesus I too am a king I too reign as a living sign of the love of God of his compassion and his tenderness # ChristTheKing <url><sep>. Dear young friends Be free and authentic be the critical conscience of society Be passionate about truth so that with your dreams you can say My life is not captive to the mindset of the world I am free because I reign with Jesus for justice love and peace # WYD<sep>. The kingship of Jesus is completely different than that of the world He did not come to dominate but to serve He did not come amid signs of power but with the power of signs He is not like other kings but he is King for the others # ChristTheKing<sep>. Today Christs invitation to Paul is directed to every one of you young people Get up Do not remain on the ground feeling sorry for yourself Theres a mission waiting for you You too can testify to what Jesus has begun to accomplish in you<sep>. The way we relate to children the extent to which we respect their innate human dignity and fundamental rights expresses what kind of adults we are and want to be and what kind of society we want to build # WorldChildrensDay<sep>. Child labor is the exploitation of children It is the denial of their rights to health education harmonious growth to play to dream It means robbing children of their future and therefore humanity itself<sep>. Dear young people if our world is to arise it needs your strength your enthusiasm your passion <url><sep>. # Prayer is primarily listening and encountering God The problems of everyday life then do not become obstacles but appeals from God himself to listen to and encounter those who are in front of us The trials of life thus change into opportunities to grow in faith and charity<sep>. Saint Joseph you who came from the periphery help us change our vision and to take care of those persons who are discarded or are on the margins of society # GeneralAudience<sep>. Dialogue between members of different religions does not take place simply for diplomacy courtesy or tolerance The goal of dialogue is to establish friendship peace and harmony to share spiritual and moral values and experiences in a spirit of truth and love # DayForTolerance<sep>. I am grateful for all the initiatives of solidarity on the occasion of the # WorldDayOfThePoor I also invite you to repeat the strong moment of witness and prayer that we lived last Friday in Assisi <url><sep>. That is the word that makes hope blossom in the world and relieves the suffering of the poor tenderness We need to overcome the temptation to be concerned only about our own problems we need to grow tender before the tragedies of our world to share its pain<sep>. Let us bring an outlook of hope to our world Let us bring it with tenderness to the poor without judging them For there with them is Jesus because there in them is Jesus who awaits us # WorldDayOfThePoor <url><sep>. A person who is generous helpful meek patient not envious does not gossip brag or lack respect cf 1 Cor 1347 this is a person who builds Heaven on earth That person may not be noticed and yet what he or she does will not be lost because good lasts forever<sep>. What is it that gives solidity to life and will never end Saint Paul tells us Love never ends 1 Cor 138<sep>. We are called to discover Christ in the poor to lend our voice to their causes but also to be their friends to listen to them to understand them and to welcome the mysterious wisdom that God wants to communicate to us through them <url><sep>. It is time that the circle of indifference be broken so as to discover once again the beauty of encounter and dialogue<sep>. It is time that violence against women cease and that they be respected and not treated like bargaining chips<sep>. It is time to be scandalised once again before the reality of children who are starving reduced to slavery tossed about in the water in the aftermath of a shipwreck innocent victims of every sort of violence<sep>. It is time for sleeves to be rolled up so dignity can be restored by creating jobs<sep>. It is time that eyes be opened to see the state of inequality in which many families live<sep>. It is time that the poor be given back their voice because for too long their requests have remained unheard<sep>. Here at the Portiuncula Saint Francis welcomed Saint Clare the first brothers and many poor people who came to him Hospitality means to open the door the door of our house and the door of our heart and to allow the person who knocks to come in<sep>. There can not be a cooperation that generates peace without concrete collective dedication that promotes integral disarmament # ParisPeaceForum2021<sep>. It is time to develop a new form of universal solidarity that is grounded in fraternity love and mutual understanding one that values people over profit one that seeks new ways to understand development and progress # COP26<sep>. If we do not want to live life poorly let us ask for the grace to see Jesus in the poor to serve Jesus in the poor # SaintMartinOfTours<sep>. Faith in Christ in your heart is like Christ in the boat Saint Augustine We wake Christ up in our hearts and then we can contemplate things with his vision because He sees beyond the storm # GeneralAudience<sep>. Let us commit ourselves to fostering an education in fraternity so that the outbursts of hatred that would destroy that fraternity will not prevail The threat of antisemitism still lurking in Europe and elsewhere is a threat that must be defused<sep>. The world needs Christians who know how to demonstrate the beauty of the Gospel by the way they live who are weavers of dialogue models of fraternal life who bring the sweet fragrance of hospitality and solidarity who protect and safeguard life<sep>. Let us # PrayTogether for the people of # Ethiopia so sorely tried by the conflict that has lasted more than a year and has caused numerous victims and a serious humanitarian crisis I renew my appeal for fraternal harmony on the peaceful path of dialogue<sep>. In the # GospelOfTheDay Mk 123844 Jesus proposes the poor wideo as a teacher of faith the sound of her few coins is more beautiful than the grandiose offerings of the rich since they express a life sincerely dedicated to God with unconditional trust<sep>. Let us care for our common home and also for ourselves trying to eliminate the seeds of conflict greed indifference ignorance fear injustice insecurity and violence Humanity has never before had at its disposal so many means for achieving this goal # COP26 # EnvConflictDay<sep>. Consolation is a strength that does not come from ourselves but from the One who is with us Jesus the Godwithus Let us encourage ourselves with this certainty with Gods consolation And let us as the Sacred Heart for the grace of being able to console when it is our turn<sep>. Passion The Heart of Christ is an impassioned heart wounded by love torn open for us on the cross That tenderness and suffering that Heart reveals what Gods passion is man<sep>. Memory To remember means to return with the heart It is good for us to nurture our memory with those who have loved us taken care of us lifted us up The Heard of Jesus reminds us that whatever happens to us in life we are loved<sep>. Contemplating the Heart of Christ we can allow ourselves to be guided by three words memory passion and comfort<sep>. Being a member of the people of God is a gift a responsibility the responsibility of witnessing by our deeds not just our words to Gods wonderful works which once known help people to acknowledge his existence and to receive his salvation # Synod<sep>. May the protection of minors be more and more a concrete ordinary priority within the Churchs educational works May it be the promotion of an open trustworthy and reliable service in strict contrast to every form of domination betrayal of intimacy or silent complicity<sep>. Today before the mystery of death that has been redeemed let us ask for the grace of perceiving adversity with new eyes Let us ask for the strength to know how to live in humble and confident silence that awaits the Lords salvation without complaining and without grumbling<sep>. Let us # PrayTogether that people who suffer from depression or burnout will find support and a light that opens them up to life # PrayerIntention <url><sep>. When we are tempted to judge others badly we must rather reflect on our own weakness It is good to ask ourselves what drives us to correct a brother or a sister and if we are not in some way coresponsible for their mistake # GeneralAudience<sep>. Love is the supreme rule for following the path of Christ it makes us aware of our weakness and merciful and in solidarity with the difficulties and weaknesses of others # GeneralAudience<sep>. There is no time to wait Unfortunately there are too many people suffering from the environmental crisis Urgent and courageous action is needed along with the responsible preparation of a future in which humanity will be capable of taking care of itself and nature # COP26<sep>. To you who pass by think about your footsteps and your final step that it be peaceful These tombs are a message of peace Stop brother and sister stop Stop weapons makers stop<sep>. There is a mysterious solidarity in Christ between those who have already passed to the other life and we pilgrims in this one Our deceased loved ones continue to take care of us from Heaven They pray for us and we pray for them and we pray with them # Prayer # FaithfulDeparted<sep>. Do not be afraid to set your sights higher to allow yourself to be loved and liberated by God Do not be afraid to let yourself be guided by the Holy Spirit Holiness does not make you less human since it is an encounter between your weakness and the power of Gods grace<sep>. Do not be afraid of holiness It will take away none of your energy vitality or joy On the contrary you will become what the Father had in mind when he created you and you will be faithful to your deepest self # UniversalSanctification<sep>. Blessed be Jesus Christ the only Saviour of the world together with this immense flowering of saintly men and women who populate the earth and who have made their life a hymn to God # AllSaintsDay<sep>. The saints who often count for little in the eyes of the world are in reality the ones who sustain it not with the weapons of money and power but with the weapon of # prayer # AllSaintsDay<sep>. I am thinking about the population of Haiti who are living in extreme conditions I ask that all leaders of nations help this country not to leave it on its own How much suffering how much pain there is in that land Let us # PrayTogether for Haiti let us not abaondon them<sep>. This is a moment to dream big to rethink our priorities what we value what we want what we seek and replan our future committing to act in our daily life on what we have dreamed of The time to act and to act together is now # COP26<sep>. The # WordOfGod must be repeated made ones own safeguarded It must reach every aspect of life involve as Jesus says in the # GospelOfTheDay the entire heart the entire soul the entire mind all of our strength Mk 1228 It must resound within us<sep>. Let us build cities that while preserving their respective cultural and religious identity are open to differences and know how to promote them in the spirit of human fraternity # FratelliTutti # WorldCitiesDay<sep>. When we pray we never do so alone even if we do not think about it we are immersed in a majestic river of invocations that precedes us and proceeds after us # Prayer # CommunionOfSaints<sep>. Climate change can be faced with a renewed sense of shared responsibility for our world and an effective solidarity based on justice a sense of our common destiny and a recognition of the unity of our human family in Gods plan for the world # Faiths4COP26<sep>. We often do the bare minimum whereas Jesus invites us to do the maximum possible How many times are we satisfied with doing our duties the precepts a few prayers whereas God who gives us life asks us for enthusaism in life<sep>. The Spirit which flows forth from Jesus Passover is the origin of the spiritual life He changes hearts not our works but the action of the Holy Spirit in us # GeneralAudience<sep>. I express my closeness to the thousands of migrants refugees in Libya I never forget you I hear your cries and pray for you We are all responsibile for these our brothers and sisters who have been victims of this serious situation for too many years Let us # PrayTogether<sep>. Jesus have mercy on me Let us make this prayer our own today Let us repeat it We must ask Jesus who can do everything for everything He can not wait to pour out his grace and joy into our hearts # GospelOfTheDay<sep>. In the # GospelOfTheDay Mk 104652 the faith of Bartimaeus the blind beggar shines He asks everything of the One who can do everything Have mercy on me He doesnt ask for a favour but presents himself he asks for mercy on his person on his life<sep>. To live out a mission means cultivating the sentiments that Jesus has to believe with Him that those around me are also my brothers and sisters May His love reawaken our hearts and make us all true missionary disciples # WorldMissionDay <url>,1

I dont like formality Theres no formality when were born and none when we die In between we should treat each other as brothers and sisters because we all want to live a happy life This is our common purpose and our right<sep>. The Dalai Lama Global Vision Summit 2021 The Power of Compassion Discover the transformative power of compassion as exemplified by the Dalai Lama with teachings and meditations from 20 experts in this worldwide free online event October 1418 <url><sep>. HHDL sends 90th birthday greetings to Archbishop Desmond Tutu followed by a short talk on compassion in his message to the 11th Annual Desmond Tutu Peace Lecture on October 7th 2021 <url> <url><sep>. If you are motivated by a wish to help on the basis of kindness compassion and respect then you can do any kind of work in any field and function more effectively with less fear or worry not being afraid of what others think or whether you will ultimately reach your goal<sep>. In my experience what we need is a calm mind and warmheartedness provides a basis for that Thats how we make ourselves happy as individuals in families local communities and nations If we can train those who are young today in these qualities well create a happier world<sep>. When affectionate relations exist between members of a family each one is confident of being able to call on the others for support In a similar way we must constantly remind ourselves of the oneness of humanity<sep>. Negative emotions like attachment and anger are part of our lives but there are antidotes to them We need to reflect not only on the damage anger and fear can do but also on the benefits to be found in cultivating compassion and nonviolence and find a balance between them<sep>. Creating a more peaceful world requires a peaceful mind and a peaceful heart As human brothers and sisters we must live together with affection and respect The only way to solve human problems and preserve the peace is to meet talk and engage in dialogue # PeaceDayChallenge<sep>. HHDL engaged in his morning meditation practice at his residence in Dharamsala HP India Photo by Tenzin Jamphel <url><sep>. The direction of our lives needs to be positive We werent born to cause trouble or do harm to others For our life to be of value I think we must develop good human qualities warmth kindness compassion Then our life will become meaningful and more peaceful happier<sep>. We all have a responsibility to educate our human brothers and sisters Inner values are the ultimate source of happiness not money and weapons whether youre talking about individuals or the whole of humanity<sep>. Even though our society doesnt emphasize it the most crucial use of knowledge and education is to understand the importance of more wholesome action and disciplining the mindessentially the development of a good heart<sep>. HHDL talks about the need for universal responsibility for the whole of humanity to learn to live happily together <url><sep>. It can sometimes seem as if one person will not be very effective However change in the world always begins with an individual who shares what he or she has learned and passes it on to others<sep>. As soon as I wake up I think about altruism I reflect on the verse that says So long as space remains I will remain in order to serve sentient beings This gives me inner strength and determination so theres no longer any danger of destructive emotions arising<sep>. Helping others brings deep satisfaction No matter how powerful we may seem to be our survival depends on the community Clearly the community is crucial to individual happiness so if we make others happy we too derive benefit<sep>. Peace in the world depends on peace within If we have that well approach problems in a spirit of dialogue compassion and respect for the rights of othersalways a better solution than resorting to a use of weapons and force External disarmament depends on inner disarmament<sep>. We should show one another love and help each another It is a mistake to pursue happiness and to seek to the avoid suffering by deceiving and humiliating other people We must try to achieve happiness and eliminate suffering by being generous and warmhearted<sep>. Since we desire the happiness that comes from having a calm mind and such peace of mind arises only from having a compassionate attitude we must make a concerted effort to develop compassion We must use all the events of our daily life to transform our thoughts and behavior<sep>. Education today needs to include principles such as compassion and nonviolence Whats more since we are missing something if we are physically fit but full of anger and anxiety we need to learn about emotional hygiene tackling destructive emotions to find peace of mind<sep>. Like anyone else I too have anger in me However I try to recall that anger is a destructive emotion Scientists say anger is bad for our health it eats into our immune system It destroys our peace of mind We shouldnt welcome it or think of it as natural or as a friend<sep>. We are social animals If someone is angry with you its important to remain warmhearted towards them Todays enemy may become tomorrows friend If they behave negatively towards you and you are hostile in return therell be no end to the trouble between you<sep>. In seeking to find the source of happiness within us we need a map of our mind and emotions We need to understand how to manage our emotions how to counter those that are negative and cultivate those that are positive That is the way to find peace within<sep>. The problems humanity faces today demand a positive mental attitude and a sense of compassion for others I firmly believe we can solve the majority of our problems by developing a sense of universal responsibilitywanting to do something for others without a selfish motive<sep>. HHDL looking out over Kangra Valley during a <break> from monsoon rains at his residence in Dharamsala HP India Photo by Tenzin Jamphel <url><sep>. HHDLs message for the International Religious Freedom Summit 2021 held in Washington DC USA on July 1315 2021 <url><sep>. Happiness derived from mere physical comfort tends to be shallow and fleeting It fails to pacify anxiety and fear Whereas if we have a calm mind it is effective in overcoming even physical pain therefore we should not neglect the inner values that are a source of a calm mind<sep>. HHDL thanks all those who sent him wishes for his 86th birthday from his residence in Dharamsala HP India on July 7 2021 <url><sep>. HHDLs message on the occasion of his 86th birthday on July 6 2021 <url><sep>. HHDL reunites online withArchbishop Desmond Tutu from his residence in India on June 24 2021 on the occasion of the release of their new movie Mission Joy Finding Happiness in Troubled Times <url><sep>. We should use our unique human intelligence to solve challenges we face and never give up or tell ourselves theres no hope If we have a positive goal and were wellmotivated to seek the wellbeing of others no matter how difficult it is to achieve we can remain determined<sep>. I am determined to help young people in any way I can because they are the future of the world And the first step in establishing good communications with other people is to smile I dont like formality Theres no formality when we are born nor when we die<sep>. If we want to see a more peaceful world we have to learn to collaborate Young people shouldnt follow previous patterns of behaviour New conditions like our interdependent globalised world require new ideas Dividing people into us and them is out of date<sep>. People face difficulties in many parts of the world but since all seven billion of us live on this one planet we should be united and stand in solidarity with each other When this blue planet is viewed from space there are no national boundaries to be seen<sep>. Im a human being a citizen of a world in which we are all dependent on each other a world in which we need a greater sense of concern for the welfare of others Wherever I go I like to meet members of the public so I can share these ideas with them<sep>. Today there is too strong a sense of us and them Theres too much sense of my friends or my enemy But we can change that Im committed to the idea of the oneness of humanity As human beings we are all the same Whats more we all have to live together on this planet<sep>. Entering into dialogue and talking things through is the only proper way of restraining people intent on perpetuating violent conflict It is important to make clear that in the 21st century old ways of thinking such as dependence on the use of force are no longer appropriate<sep>. People today may feel anxious about the future but we can take strength from the fact that more and more of us are genuinely concerned to protect the environment taking account of the welfare of the whole of humanity as well as the health of the planet our only home<sep>. The ability to smile seems to be unique to human beings As social animals we need friends Friendship is based on trust and trust grows when we show each other genuine affection If we are honest truthful and of service to others we can also feel selfconfident<sep>. Our intelligence helps us regulate our emotions Fear for example is based on mistrust and a lack of selfconfidence If on the other hand we remain honest and truthful open and tolerant we will not only have greater selfconfidence well easily overcome fear<sep>. There is time for us to create a better happier world but we cant sit back and expect a miracle We each have actions we must take by living our lives meaningfully helping others whenever we can and making every effort to do them no harm<sep>. Our lives depend on hope If you have hope youll be able to overcome problems you face But if youre without hope your difficulties will increase Hope is linked to compassion and loving kindness<sep>. Im sorry to learn that my good friend Gandhian environmentalist Shri Sunderlal Bahuguna has passed away Some years ago he asked me to spread the word about the importance of planting trees and caring for them whenever I can and I promised to do so <url><sep>. Peace of mind and physical wellbeing are closely related Some years ago a scientist at Emory University told me that continuous anger fear and suspicion tend to eat into our immune system Besides peace of mind and warmheartedness bring us confidence<sep>. We are selfcentred and selfish but we need to be wisely selfish not foolishly so If we neglect others we too lose We have to support others We can educate people to understand that the best way to fulfil their own interest is to be concerned about the welfare of others<sep>. Gradually people are beginning to recognize that peace of mind has an important role to play in our day to day lives Mental afflictions like anger fear and frustration detract from our good health so all seven billion human beings alive today need peace of mind here and now<sep>. When were born our mothers show us compassion This is a natural response without which we wouldnt survive Our lives begin with an experience of kindness and compassion Mothers Day is a good day to remember how important compassion can be<sep>. HHDL speaks on Emptiness and Compassion as Antidotes to Destructive Emotions as part of the Science amp Wisdom of Emotions Summit organized by Mind amp Life Institute and the Awake Network on May 5 2021 <url><sep>. Everybody knows that love and compassion are important Now the time has come when were experiencing the limitations of material values Were facing many unnecessary problems So gradually were returning to our basic human values with a new appreciation<sep>. At this critical time during this alarming Covid19 surge I have asked the Dalai Lama Trust to make a donation to the PMCARES Fund as a token of our solidarity with our Indian brothers and sisters <url>,1

252,Recognise the location Recognise the stance Notice the influence of T20 has crept in with that first shot Reverse sweep <url><sep>. Dindigul Dragons missing their talisman player <url><sep>.

Lara genius AB genius <url><sep>. @<user> Geniuses<sep>. There is no doubt in my mind that @<user> has been one of the most influential players of his generation A genius a true successor to Lara Wish you well AB I am sure your countless fans at @<user> will want to give you a befitting sendoff You were a great combo<sep>. @<user> How old are you Yash<sep>. @<user> We didnt<sep>. @<user> You know the situation there better but everyone deserves a second chance and sometimes people emerge stronger from mistakes<sep>. I have seen that change with people I have worked with too And it is welcome which is why I am hopeful that out of this turmoil a more aware and understanding generation will take root 44<sep>. But they had to change amp the effect has been remarkable They have rules but the illbehaved snobbish rude people seem to have been replaced Hopefully with the greater awareness of hurt the new generation will be more open amp will call out discriminatory behaviour 34<sep>. that will change I have seen change at Lords for eg It was a terrible disgusting place to go to people looked down at you were rude made you feel they were putting up with you for having to let you in In the 90s and at the turn of the century I hated going there 24<sep>. A lot of the time racism is hurtful amp intentional Sometimes it is in the air part of what seems an acceptable spectrum of behaviour Seemingly fair amp reasonable people will do or say things because no one has called it out amp it seems okay to do so Post # AzeemRafiq 14<sep>. For young people who may not be aware of what attitudes towards make up and grooming were this will be a very interesting read from a market research and consumer behaviour expert # RamaBijapurkarhttpstcon6dlFUQQGX<sep>. I suspect Australia will have to go back to Steve Smith as captain Pat Cummins would be a deserving candidate but as a large hearted fast bowler who gives every spell everything he has and plays all three formats his workload will need to be managed<sep>. Novy Kapadia loved all sport but football was part of him You could see joy reflected on him when he talked football in any case with Novy joy and happiness was rarely far away Few gave as much to his profession as Novy did A sports lover of the greatest purity<sep>. @<user> Haha now you only need to look for 9<sep>. Rahul Dravid as coach and VVS Laxman as head of the NCA are excellent appointments not just because they were great cricketers but because they have an outstanding work ethic love Indian cricket deeply are givers and as important as anything else are very honest people<sep>. A very happy birthday to @<user> When on song he was such fun to watch Just the kind of no 6 India could do with today Yusuf bhai har saal ki tarah yeh saal bhi enjoy karen<sep>. So good to see @<user> and @<user> playing starring roles for their franchise in Australia We need to get our # WIPL up and running soon<sep>. @<user> Will happen by and by I am sure And for that we will need the IPL to throw up a crop of 567 kind of players<sep>. Agree with Rohit Sharma that people must play similar roles in the Indian team that they do day in day out in franchise cricket No 567 are specialist positions too<sep>. In 1930 having regained the Ashes the Australian team played a game in honour of Jack Ryder It included the prodigiously talented Archie Jackson who sadly died at 23 of tuberculosis His signature is on this bat too It should be a collectors dream<sep>.

Enjoyed it Great crew Very pleasant experience <url><sep>. Post tournament emptiness is difficult to explain Excited about going home again but there is an emptiness on the periphery Normally lasts about a day<sep>. # Australia just too powerful What a player Mitch Marsh has become Hopefully his body becomes a partner in his future because he is too good to be playing as little he has Brilliant today<sep>. 172 is a fine score in a big final But I dont think it is safe We have a fabulous game on our hands<sep>. 4 overs 316 in a T20 final is worth its weight in gold Hazlewood gets better and better at T20 cricket<sep>. The sign of a great batsman Got to love how Kane Williamson has switched gears without a slog in sight This is a stunning innings 1819 then 5120<sep>.

Am I missing something here I can not see a reason why # HanumaVihari is not in the test squad for # IndvsNZ Injury Cant be on cricketing groundsthere hasnt been any firstclass cricket Surely it cant be right His last innings for India was that heroic effort at Sydney<sep>. @<user> Interestingly there was no dew yesterday<sep>. When Finch and Williamson go out to toss on the 14th the dugouts will be more tense than they would be in the death overs # TossToWin<sep>. Hands on heart how many had predicted an # AusvsNZ final I must admit I had England Pakistan and India as my favourites But two sensational run chases later they deserve to be there<sep>. I know sport can sometimes be cruel but I can not see children crying<sep>. You would have thought that if one team could make 176 look enough it was Pakistan But this Australian team has just got better and better as the tournament has progressed<sep>. Twice in two days we have thought the bowling side had it covered Twice it has ended with an over left There is no limit to what these hitters can get now<sep>.

I found the book to be valuable on a number of levels and will have more to say about it soon <url><sep>. The first time I met David Sengeh I was blown away by his intellect his ambition and his sense of humor He has been a remarkable advocate for Sierra Leone and Im confident that well be hearing about @<user> amazing work for decades to come <url><sep>. Africas success against wild polio last year is one of the most inspiring stories in global health Im optimistic that with the commitment and collaboration that achieved that goal countries in the region can beat all forms of the virus and # EndPolio <url><sep>.

Every climate action we take must be toward the goal of reaching zero That means rapidly deploying the technologies we have today to reduce emissions and investing immediately in the solutions we still need to get the world to zero<sep>. Avoiding a disaster will require courage ambition and partnership among leaders in every sector around the globe As the report makes clear no region will be spared by climate change It will take all of us to meet this challenge<sep>.

All my respects to the USTA the US Open organisers and the ATP for trying to put the event together for the players and the fans around the world through TV<sep>. We know that the reduced tennis calendar is barbaric this year after 4 months stopped with no play I understand and thank for the efforts they are putting in to make it happen We have just seen the announcement of Madrid not being played this year<sep>. After many thoughts I have decided not to play this years US Open The situation is very complicated worldwide the COVID19 cases are increasing it looks like we still dont have control of it<sep>. Esta es una decisin que no querra tomar pero en este caso sigo mi corazn para decidir que por ahora prefiero no viajar<sep>. A dia de hoy la situacin es complicada para hacer torneos y todo mi respeto a la USTA organizadores del US Open y a la ATP por los esfuerzos que estn haciendo para que se juegue el torneo para los millones de fans que lo vern por TV o en las plataformas digitales<sep>. si bien entiendo y agradezco los esfuerzos que todas las partes estn poniendo para que se jueguen torneos,1

If you dont like your job know you can do better and have enough saved in crypto to pay for 4 months expenses convert to USDC earn 7 on DeFi and go look for a job you like There will never be a better time to be looking for a job than these next few months <url><sep>. @<user> @<user> @<user> @<user> @<user> The underpinning problem the legit companies will face will mirror that of the internet boom Dilution So many companies coming in to the space will crowd out the marginal companies and it will take time for the best to become big Like we saw with the survivors of the bubble<sep>. @<user> @<user> @<user> @<user> @<user> Lots of tech companies have been frauds Lots of nontech companies are frauds And there will be many more crypto frauds There will be a Wolf Of Crypto movie in 20 yrs But it wont change the fundamental value that underpins them nor the game changing companies created<sep>. @<user> @<user> @<user> @<user> @<user> In this case Smart Contracts create a unique productivity proposition Just like you need tokens to play at the arcade Airline Miles for the awards you will need tokens to use the applications And then we can talk about how DAOs can change organizations Not all But enough<sep>. @<user> @<user> @<user> @<user> @<user> It happens I went through the same thing in the mid 90s Like when were the first commercial streaming site and people laughed because of radiosTVs or first HDTV network in 2001 and people laughed because of price etc Not all worked But the underlying principles always did<sep>. @<user> @<user> @<user> @<user> @<user> Thats what makes a market As an entrepreneur I see it 180 degrees away<sep>. @<user> @<user> @<user> @<user> @<user> Have you looked at how smart contracts on various crypto networks work<sep>. @<user> @<user> @<user> @<user> @<user> I think you are looking at this as a closed system where all trx take place in set environment with 0 externalities That isnt the case BTC is extensible in ways that can create nonbtc income<sep>. @<user> @<user> @<user> @<user> @<user> @<user> Got it You think what is mined is the 50m they wont get back Kind of like all the people security and platforms required for anyone to open and use a bank account Depositors aint getting it back<sep>. @<user> @<user> @<user> @<user> @<user> @<user> Can you share your data source please And you are incorrect about no other sources of revenue I can loan my btc as i can my stocks bonds cash I can hedge it And I can do it without a 3rd party<sep>. @<user> @<user> @<user> @<user> @<user> Thats not to say other crypto cant accomplish the same I think many will be better for bigger and more advanced app But just like other precious metals can be jewelry The brand is BTC and the long term utility is definitely there if you look at all the ways you can use it<sep>. @<user> @<user> @<user> @<user> @<user> If you want to keep small daily replenished amounts of BTC to enable trx your risk of loss is minimal vs the value you gain in timesimplicity Thats real use and reason for hundreds of millions to buy tiny amounts where personal banking is hardexpensive including the USA<sep>. @<user> @<user> @<user> @<user> @<user> The amount of work we all have to do to open a bank acct is RIDICULOUS As is the cost and time for transactions Trustless has HUGE value that optimizes the most valuable asset we dont own Time You are not recognizing that value You can use BTC to do all these things<sep>. @<user> @<user> @<user> @<user> @<user> Again you are ignoring the fungible utility of BTC Think of it as a bank account without having to go to the bank Lend borrow fractionalize to send to people That is utility<sep>. @<user> @<user> @<user> @<user> @<user> That demand is the function of change and

apply<sep>. @<user> @<user> @<user> @<user> @<user> BTC also has utility that is being added in the DeFi universe Things you cant do with gold Its easier to buy sell hold fractionalize borrow against lend to others than with Gold That is what you are undervaluing Buy 50 of gold and then ask what you can do with it<sep>. @<user> @<user> @<user> @<user> @<user> And like BTC golds gospel is built on the false notion that its a hedge But unlike Gold BTC does have the ability to evolve and add new features Its utility will improve and its far easier for anyone with 1 to buy some BTC Try that with gold<sep>. @<user> @<user> @<user> @<user> @<user> Except that the majority of value is speculation And the reality is that none of those speculatorstraders have any intent of taking physical possession Instead they buy a digital transaction in a ledger And jewelry is not intrinsic value its vanity value Kinda like BTC<sep>. @<user> @<user> @<user> @<user> @<user> Now do Gold<sep>. @<user>

347,"The preaching of the # Gospel reinvigorates hope because it reminds us that God is present in everything He accompanies us and gives us the courage and creativity we need to start ever anew<sep>. Keep in mind on his feast day what Saint # JohnPaulII said to us Be vigilant so that nothing might separate us from the love of Christ neither false slogans nor erroneous ideologies nor caving into the temptation to fall into compromises with what is not of God<sep>. Christian # prayer instils an invincible hope in the human heart whatever experience may touch us on our journey Gods love can turn it into good<sep>. True freedom freedom in Christ does not seek personal interests but is guided by love and is expressed in service to others especially to the poor Love makes us free it leads us to choose and to do good it motivates us to serve # GeneralAudience<sep>. Come Holy Spirit of love open our hearts to listen Come Spirit of holiness renew the holy faithful People of God Come creator Spirit renew the face of the earth # Synod # ListeningChurch <url><sep>. Prayer is like the oxygen of life Prayer draws down upon us the presence of the Holy Spirit who always leads us forward <url><sep>. Persevering in the daily recitation of the # HolyRosary we can meet each other every day with the Virgin Mother learning from her how to cooperate fully with the plan of salvation that God has for each one of us # ChildrenPraying<sep>. Today thousands of children around the world are taking part in the campaign organized by # AidToTheChurchInNeedpraying the Rosary for unity and peaceLet us # PrayTogether with them to Our Lady with the same trust as these little ones have in our Heavenly Mother # ChildrenPraying<sep>. Dear brothers and sisters have a good journey May we be open to the Holy Spirits surprises the grace of encounter reciprocal listening and discernment joyfully convinced that even as we seek the Lord He always comes with His love to meet us first # Synod # ListeningChurch<sep>. The environmental and social crisis are two sides of the same coin Therefore strategies for resolving them demand an integrated approach to combating poverty restoring dignity to the excluded and at the same time protecting nature # EndPoverty<sep>. Jesus asks us to immerse ourselves compassionately in the lives of those we meet as He has done with us God is love and love is humble it does not exalt itself but descends like the rain that falls to the earth and brings life # GospelOfTheDay Mk 103545<sep>. All of us religious leaders that we never use Gods name to foment wars Let us stand by our people the workers the humble and fight together with them so that integral human development may become a reality Let us build bridges of love<sep>. That governments and all politicians work for the common good Let them beware of listening only to the economic elite may they be servants of those people who ask for land shelter and work and a good life in harmony with all humanity and creation<sep>. Powerful countries to stop aggression blockades and unilateral sanctions against any country anywhere on earth and that conflicts be resolved in multilateral fora such as the United Nations<sep>. That the media put an end to the logic of posttruth disinformation defamation slander and that sick attraction for scandal and that they seek to contribute to human fraternity<sep>. The telecommunications giants to liberalise access to educational material and exchange with teachers via the internet so that poor children can be educated even under quarantine<sep>. Technology giants to stop preying on human weakness peoples vulnerability in order to make a profit<sep>. Arms manufacturers and dealers to totally cease their activity that foments violence and war often in the context of geopolitical games that costs millions of lives and displaces many people<sep>. The big food corporations to stop imposing monopolistic production and distribution structures that inflate prices and end up withholding bread from the hungry<sep>. The large mining oil forestry real estate agribusiness companies to stop destroying nature to stop polluting to stop intoxicating people and food<sep>. Financial groups and international credit institutions to guarantee poor countries the basic needs of their people and to waive those debts so often contracted against the interests of those same peoples<sep>. The big laboratories to liberalise patents and to carry out a gesture of humanity and allow every human being access to the vaccine<sep>. We must adapt our socioeconomic models so they have a human face because many models have lost it Thinking about these situations in Gods name I want to ask<sep>. The Spirit asks us to listen to the questions concerns and hopes of every Church people and nation And to listen to the world to the challenges and changes that it sets before us Let us not soundproof our hearts let us listen to one another # Synod # ListeningChurch<sep>. The fight against hunger demands we overcome the cold logic of the market which is greedily focused on mere economic profit and the reduction of food to a commodity and strengthening the logic of solidarity # WorldFoodDay<sep>. The Word of God summons us to discernment and guides the # Synod so it may be filled with grace a healing process guided by the Spirit in which Jesus calls us to ask what God wants to say to us in this time and the direction in which he wants to lead us # ListeningChurch<sep>. Rural women have much to teach us about how effort and sacrifice enable us to build the fabric that ensures access to food the equitable distribution of goods and the possibility for every human being to realise their aspirations # RuralWomenDay<sep>. # SaintTeresaofJesus teaches us that prayer is not to experience extraordinary things but to unite ourselves to Christ And the works of charity are the sign that this union is real<sep>. The # Synod is a process of spiritual discernment that unfolds in adoration in prayer and in dialogue with the word of God # ListeningChurch<sep>. The Lord has liberated us from slavery freely and set us on the path to walk in the fullness of freedom # GeneralAudience<sep>. Today we remember the final apparition of # OurLadyOfFatima I entrust you all to the heavenly Mother of God May she accompany you on your way and be of comfort in the trials of life<sep>. Participating in a # Synod means taking the same path as the Word made flesh following in his footsteps listening to his word and the words of others discovering with amazement that the Holy Spirit always surprises us with fresh paths and new ways of speaking<sep>. Let us invoke the Holy Spirit with greater fervour and frequency and humbly listen to him journeying together as He the source of communion and mission desires with docility and courage # Synod # ListeningChurch<sep>. True encounter arises only from listening # Synod # ListeningChurch <url><sep>. The experience of encounter changes us and it frequently suggests new ways we never thought of taking This is how God so often points out new paths Everything changes once we are capable of genuine encounters with Him and with one another # Synod # ListeningChurch<sep>. In this # Synod we too are called to become experts in the art of encounter by taking time to encounter the Lord and one another to listen to what the Spirit wants to say to the Church # ListeningChurch<sep>. In the # GospelOfTheDay Jesus listens with his heart and not just with his ears He does more than simply answer the rich mans question but lets him tell his story to speak freely about himself # Synod # ListeningChurch<sep>. Celebrating a # Synod means walking on the same road together Let us look at Jesus in the # GospelOfTheDay who first encounters the rich man on the road then he listens to his questions and finally he helps him discern what he must do to inherit eternal life # ListeningChurch<sep>. Dear brothers and sisters may this Synod be a true season of the Spirit For we need the Spirit the ever new breath of God who sets us free from every form of selfabsorption revives what is moribund loosens shackles and spreads joy # ListeningChurch<sep>. The Synod offers us the opportunity to become a Church of closeness that does not stand aloof from life but immerses herself in todays problems and needs bandaging wounds and healing broken hearts with the balm of God # ListeningChurch<sep>. The Synod offers us the opportunity to become a listening Church to <break> out of our routine and pause from our pastoral concerns in order to stop and listen # ListeningChurch<sep>. Let us experience this moment of encounter listening and reflection as a season of grace that offers us the opportunity of becoming a synodal Church an open square where all can feel at home and participate # Synod # ListeningChurch<sep>. Synodality is an expression of the Churchs style The word synod says it all it means journeying together And the movement is the fruit of docility to the Holy Spirit who directs this history in which all have a part to play # Synod<sep>. We are about to begin a synodal process Towards a Synodal Church Communion Participation Mission This process was conceived as an exercise in mutual listening involving the entire People of God # Synod<sep>. We undertake the journey to cultivate peace in Gods name aware that we are brothers and sisters Even though some foment division and conflict we believe in the importance of journeying together for peace with one another never again against one another # FraternityForFuture<sep>. If peoples are to remain brothers and sisters prayer must rise unceasingly to Heaven and one single word constantly echo on earth peace # FraternityForFuture <url><sep>. Today the Church celebrates the Feast of # OurLadyOfTheRosary In this month of October I invite you to recite this prayer allowing yourselves to be led by Mary toward Jesus her Son<sep>. This coming 9 October the new synodal way will begin Let us # PrayTogether so that the reflections and exchanges of this Assembly might help us rediscover the joy of being the People of God who journeys together listening to everyone # Synod # ListeningChurch<sep>. Freedom makes free to the extent to which it transforms a persons life and directs it toward the good # GeneralAudience<sep>. If we desire a more fraternal world we need to educate the younger generations to acknowledge appreciate and love each person regardless of physical proximity place of birth or where they live # GlobalCompactOnEducation <url><sep>. Today on this World # Teachers Day we wish to express our gratitude to every teacher and our concern for education # GlobalCompactOnEducation<sep>. Openness to interdependence and sharing the dynamism of love and a call to respect these are three interpretative keys that can shed light on our efforts to care for our common home # Faiths4COP26 <url><sep>. # COP26 in Glasgow is called to provide effective responses to the unprecedented ecological crisis and the crisis of values we are presently experiencing and in this way to offer concrete hope to future generations Let us accompany it with our spiritual closeness # Faiths4COP26<sep>. Care for our common home is also a call to respect respect for creation respect for our neighbour respect for ourselves and for the Creator # SeasonOfCreation<sep>. Together with # SaintFrancis we praise You Father with all your creatures who have come forth from your powerful hands They are yours and are filled with your presence and your tenderness # LaudatoSi # SeasonOfCreation<sep>. Let us # PrayTogether for the gift of peace for the beloved land of Myanmar so that the hands of those who live there no longer need to wipe away tears of pain and death but instead join together to overcome difficulties and work together to bring peace<sep>. The # GospelOfTheDay Mk 10216 says that Jesus is very tender with the little ones The difficulties and situations that reveal our weakness are privileged opportunities to experience His love in dark or lonely moments Gods tenderness towards is made even more present<sep>. Being poor in spirit is the way of achieving everything as persons and as a society it leads toward using our resources techologies and talents for integral human development for the common good social justice and the care of our common home # Beatitudes<sep>. To you young people I once again entrust the task of placing fraternity at the centre of the economy Now as never before we feel the need for young people who through study and practice know how to demonstrate that a different economy exists # EoF2021<sep>. # GuardianAngels help us in our lives and show us where we need to go Our angel is the daily bridge to our encounter with the Father<sep>. Life is a gift and when it is long it is a privilege The wealth of many years is a wealth in terms of the persons themselves their experience and history # IDOP2021<sep>. Saint #ThereseOfTheChildJesus is one of the saints who speaks to us the most about God's grace and how God takes care of us, takes us by the hand and lets us easily climb the mountain of life - if only we abandon ourselves completely to Him.",1

362,"HHDL exchanges early morning greetings with security personnel from the balcony of his residence in Dharamsala HP India Photo by Tenzin Jamphel <url><sep>. On Earth Day 2021 I appeal to my brothers and sisters throughout the world to look at the challenges and the opportunities before us on this one blue planet that we share Let us commit ourselves to making a positive difference to the earths environment <url><sep>. As human beings we all want to be happy His Holiness the Dalai Lama says the key to this is finding peace of mind In this short video he outlines how destructive emotions disturb our inner peace and steps we can take to secure it <url><sep>. I pray each day that every human being indeed every sentient being should be happy So if you come across individuals facing problems help them Share their problems and try to bring them peace of mind Wherever you live try to create a happy community<sep>. I often say that we should eliminate the notion of them We should be enough the whole world is part of us This isnt some kind of oldfashioned way of thinking or an altruistic forgetting of your own interests I want happiness and in order to achieve that I need you<sep>. Following the death of HRH Prince Philip the Duke of Edinburgh I pray for him and offer my condolences to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth to Prince Charles and the royal family at this sad time <url><sep>. Why do we need compassion Experience tells us that it brings inner strength It also benefits others and we face many unnecessary problems when we lack it To understand this we must develop a holistic way of seeing the bigger picture which means we must use our intelligence<sep>. We need to learn to manage our emotions and achieve inner peace Our education should include an understanding of how to achieve peace of mind Education should teach us how to live properly how to balance our wish for physical comfort with mental comfort<sep>. Warmheartedness Even animals appreciate it If you are motivated by loving kindness it will be reflected in the happy expression on your face Real beauty is inner beauty<sep>. His Holiness the Dalai Lama congratulates the President of India Ram Nath Kovind on successful surgery <url><sep>. We must nurture positive things Positive emotions are really a benefit to yourself and others Warmheartedness and a sense of responsibility clearly have an important role in modern society in every field Training can make a difference so we need to plan a better education<sep>. We have a basic instinct for compassion but we need to develop it Concern for others is related to human rights and everyone needs to be assured of their human rights because everyone wants and has a right to be happy<sep>. What gives me hope is that if we dig deeper into how our emotions work we find that attachment and hatred depend on a misconception of reality We can evaluate them weighing their pros and cons We need to use our intelligence to regulate such emotions<sep>. If you focus narrowly on the problem as you see it you might well lose hope but if you look at it from a wider perspective its easier to be more positive When I decided to leave Tibet we set out not knowing if wed live to see the following day but I never gave up hope<sep>. HHDL at home praying as he does every day for the happiness of all sentient beings In particular he spends some time praying that the suffering that has come from Covid19 pandemic will soon come to an end and that those who are sick will make a complete and swift recovery <url><sep>. When I meet people I just think of myself as another human being I dont think about being a Buddhist a Tibetan or the Dalai Lama just a human being I find its easier to make friends that way And I find that a smile is a true expression of friendship<sep>. For most of us our mother is our first teacher In my own case it was my mother who first revealed to me the power of compassion Since they are especially skilled in nurturing compassion and human values we need women to take the lead in creating a more compassionate society<sep>. His Holiness the Dalai Lama receiving the first dose of COVID19 vaccine at Zonal Hospital Dharamsala HP India on March 6 2021 <url><sep>. As we teach children to observe physical hygiene for its health benefits we need to teach them to cultivate emotional hygiene to tackle destructive emotions and find peace of mind<sep>. Friendship depends on trust and trust depends on having a strong sense of concern for the welfare of others Be honest truthful and warmhearted Make compassion the basis of your determination Think of what the future can be not what happened in the past<sep>. If you focus narrowly on the problem as you see it you might well lose hope but if you look at it from a wider perspective its easier to be more positive When I decided to leave Tibet we set out not knowing if we would live to see the following day but I never gave up hope<sep>. Compassion is the basis of our survival not just a religious matter Our very life depends on the affection of others so its in our interest to take their concerns into account We must think more about inner values and cultivate compassion in our own lives<sep>. II offer my condolences to those who have lost loved ones as a result of the recent glacial burst in the Chamoli district of Uttarakhand India and pray for them I also pray for the safety and well being of those who are still missing <url><sep>.

Warmheartedness and compassion are conducive to our physical and mental wellbeing anger hatred and fear are not This is why some scientists today talk about warmheartedness ensuring a healthy mind and a healthy body<sep>.

I offer my profound congratulations to Joe Biden on becoming President of the United States of America I am so pleased that he is giving high priority to the urgent issue of climate change I pray for his success in meeting the challenges that lie ahead <url><sep>.

Wherever I go I try to cultivate a sense of the oneness of humanity I see everyone I meet as being essentially the same And people respond positively to this Animals too Fear leads to isolation so its helpful to be open to others<sep>.

Under a bright blue sky HHDL trains his binoculars on the snowcapped peaks behind his residence in Dharamsala HP India on December 19 2020 Photo by Tenzin Jamphel <url><sep>. If those of you who are young today are going to fulfil a vision for a happier more peaceful future in this world you need to learn to live each day in a more meaningful way You need to sharpen your human intelligence through study but you also need to develop a warm heart<sep>. We must learn that humanity is one big family Were all brothers and sisters physically mentally and emotionally the same But we still focus far too much on differences instead of what we have in common After all every one of us is born the same way and dies the same way<sep>. We can no longer keep exploiting the resources of this earththe trees the water and the mineralswithout any care for the coming generations It is common sense that we can not survive if we keep working against nature We must learn to live in harmony with nature<sep>. Modern science doesnt include a deep understanding of the workings of mind and emotions but some scientists are showing an interest in finding out We need to cultivate emotional hygiene learning how to reduce anger anxiety and fear The key is to cultivate peace of mind<sep>. Id like to congratulate Ranjitsinh Disale on being named the worlds most exceptional teacher and to express my admiration for his generosity in sharing half the prize money with runners up in the competition He has set an example of compassion in action <url><sep>. We can learn how to cultivate peace of mind Then we can apply our intelligence to extend a compassionate attitude on an individual family community and global level Its our nature to be compassionate so education can teach us to appreciate that were brothers and sisters<sep>. My dedication is to serve the 7 billion human beings on this planet and the other creatures with whom we share it If you can help and serve others but if you cant at least dont harm them then in the end you will feel no regret<sep>. Just as we teach children to observe physical hygiene for its benefits to our health we need to teach them to cultivate emotional hygiene They need to learn how to tackle their destructive emotions and achieve peace of mind<sep>. The aim of education should be to train happy individuals who make up a peaceful society It requires warmheartedness and taking a broadminded holistic and farsighted approach that enables people to cope whatever happens It entails focussing on the good of the community<sep>. Speaking for myself I have no hesitation in supporting initiatives that are related to protecting the environment because threats to our environment are a question of our survival # OurOnlyHome Now Available <url> <url><sep>.

Ask children whether they prefer smiling faces or stern ones Obviously the way to bring about harmony and friendship is to smile We need to cultivate such childlike attributes that are the basis of human values and remember that we are the same and have to live together<sep>. We are truly brothers and sisters We all face the same kind of problems and we all have the ability to overcome them That means putting our human brains to good use combined with a strong sense of warmheartedness<sep>. Like anything else life has a beginning and in due course must end In between those two events the important goal should be to live meaningfully not to create trouble for others If we can do that when the end comes we can go feeling at peace<sep>. As an avowed campaigner for the elimination of all nuclear weapons I welcome the fact that the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons has now been ratified by fifty countries and will come into force from January next year <url><sep>. To achieve peace of mind its important to have patience and its people who are hostile and antagonistic rather than our friends who teach us patience Its not difficult to make your friends smile but bringing a smile to your enemys face is a real achievement<sep>. Wherever you live try to create a happy community I pray that every human being indeed every sentient being should be happy So if you come across individuals facing problems help them Share their problems and try to bring them peace of mind<sep>.

368,With any other bowling side this would only have been a par score <url><sep>. And to think they didnt pick him in the first place Fakhar Zaman has given Pakistan a total that their bowlers should be able to defend<sep>. They are getting it <url><sep>. Pakistan need a big finish from their power hitters now They are a bit behind where they would have liked to be<sep>. Australia have bowled better than this<sep>. Excellent start Interesting that Maxwell continues to be used upfront against two quality right handers<sep>. If you want to reach out to her here is the link againhttpstcorukFUvyaXfAnd she is at @<user> <url><sep>. This is the biggest challenge # Pakistan could have faced Batting first and setting a target against a quality bowling lineup If they can trump this situation they will command even more respect than they already do<sep>. There are many people doing outstanding selfless work in this area Since you mentioned autism awareness @<user> here is an article about an extraordinary woman you might like to read httpstcorukFUvyaXf <url><sep>. From what I see from the outside Humility Discipline Focus Leadership <url><sep>. As I have often said voicing # MissionISRO is among the most fulfilling things I have done The 2nd season is out on @<user> Thanks @<user> And thanks to @<user> for making a national space mission cool enough to be on a tee Unsolicited <url><sep>. Spare a thought for # England Played a high level of T20 cricket without their enforcer at the top Roy a great allrounder Stokes and their two best death bowlers Archer and Mills If they are fit and available they will still be the team to beat in Australia in 11 months<sep>. And this too is twitter Where good people do good things @<user> More strength to you my friend <url><sep>. @<user> Cheers<sep>. This is such an unforgiving format You miss a bit and you vanish New Zealands extra bowler approach at least today trumped Englands extra batsman approach<sep>. Lords has been overcome Daryl Mitchell And Jimmy Neesham This was worth being here for What a team this @<user> is<sep>. No need What a finish <url><sep>. Super over <url><sep>. Game on This is an inspired chase Still England marginally ahead but this is now just two big overs away from NZ<sep>. Competitive Makes # ENGLAND the more favoured side at this stage but not a done deal yet<sep>. They just keep pulling it back # NewZealand The dismissal of Buttler is a huge moment<sep>. How good have # NewZealand been in these first two overs The ball has swungI wonder for how long though<sep>. Looks like a good track maybe a high scoring gameInstinct says England<sep>. What do you make of this as a team of the tournament Based purely on performances here Buttler Babar Asalanka Markram Malik Moeen Wiese Hasaranga Nortje Hazlewood Afridi van der Dussen for Asalanka or Malik Bumrah for Hazlewood<sep>. @<user> @<user> Tula asa tar nahi na vatala na ki tujhya baddal<sep>. Well done @<user> Youve been there when Indian cricket has called and you can be proud of what you have achieved<sep>. Okay then @<user> on public demand what is the line used in the Caribbean when a batsman hits a six<sep>. That 10th over from @<user> was just so clever<sep>. How will it be to see @<user> sitting in the # Pakistan dugout as they play # Australia with his mate # JustinLanger in the other dugout<sep>. No Usama I was talking cricket and logic Two qualification spots out of three contenders is always more comfortable than two out of four no Sometimes in our desire to search for what we want to see and in our need to throw a punch at someone we ignore simple logic <url><sep>. Love watching him bat but Im afraid I didnt say that I said he is their best batsman in the context of what he brings to the side I think he is in a group of three or four in the best category which is a great place to be in too <url><sep>. See every family needs the elder brother # Hafeez # ShoaibMalik<sep>. Time tends to stretch a little bit the world seems gentler calmer when Williamson is batting<sep>. I know Rashid likes to bowl outside the Power Play but # Afghanistan needed him earlier today The game is set up now<sep>. Given how the track has played Afghanistan are 2530 short at least Comfortable chase<sep>. Top innings from Najibullah Zadran Even if only just he is singlehandedly responsible for keeping # Afghanistan in the game<sep>. Reason you admire # NewZealand Play such good cricket Virtually dragged the game their way already<sep>. # Afghanistan took the right decision on winning the toss It is what gives them their best chance # NewZealand have started well and would like to keep this score under 130<sep>. This is the same surface that was used yesterday for # AUSvWI Very good track # Afghanistan would like to bat first and put runs on the board even though chasing teams have won 67 in afternoon games<sep>. Do join @<user> @<user> and me on # CricbuzzLive at 1500 hrs as we look ahead to # NZvsAfg The scenario is clear NZ win they go through if they lose they are out But do remember NZ are a very good World Cup unit for a reason<sep>. # SouthAfrica kept improving as they went along Van der Dussen and Shamsi enhanced reputations and Markram and Nortje could make the team of the tournament for many And from the outside I get the impression that they found a fine leader in Temba Bavuma<sep>. # SouthAfrica continue to impress They are giving themselves a real chance now # Australia will be a bit edgy now<sep>. So the two numbers that matter England need to make more than 86 to qualify South Africa need to keep England down to less than 131 to qualify So England cross 86 they qualify They cross 131 Australia qualify<sep>. We have seen over the last few days that when teams are pushed to play a certain way they discover how good they can really be # SouthAfrica have been sensational so far and van der Dussen and Markram took their game to another level<sep>. The manner in which @<user> has reinvented himself at no 4 is astonishing Very few players have the versatility to bat at that no in T20 cricket Either soak the pressure of early wickets or like today get into finisher mode instantly<sep>. @<user> Haha Chalo ek din sunataun<sep>. Beautiful Well done # Australia By honouring and applauding Gayle and Bravo you showed your class<sep>. While Australia will rejoice at the form of David Warner I think Pakistan will be quite concerned at the way Mitch Marsh has played He looks very good even in those 5 balls against Bangladesh<sep>. Two of the very greatest in the T20 game on view for the West Indies for possibly the last time Irrespective of how this tournament has gone @<user> and @<user> have been jewels It will be very strange to see the West Indies take the field without them<sep>. @<user> Sanjay if you are looking to find an outlet for your frustration am cool with what you say Otherwise I might contest your conclusion Cheers<sep>. Just love watching KL Rahul bat<sep>. I think Indias heavy artillery arrived a little late But the big guns are booming now<sep>. Clinical The bowlers have done their bit It is now up to the batsmen to make an assault on that NRR<sep>. Wishing @<user> a very happy birthday I genuinely believe this year will be the start of the next peak he will scale in his career<sep>. I hope you are following what is happening with Yorkshire cricket A great club out of tune with the world we live in and hurtling downwards Saying sorry can not be that difficult<sep>. Do watch this @<user> has been one of the legends of the modern T20 format He has enriched it and as he says goodbye to West Indies cricket we must applaud What a # Champion <url><sep>. Sri Lanka leave on a high and take the West Indies with them Clearly # SriLanka are tomorrows team<sep>. The # WestIndies scorecard illustrates the great team that was and a glimpse at what it will be Many going out and some showing the way,1
