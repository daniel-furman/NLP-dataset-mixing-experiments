terminallist<sep>. happy easter<sep>. some people might not know this but i spent a good chunk of my childhood living in alaska my dad worked in the gold mines in kenai our babysitter rose was native alaskan and her three sons were my best friends my family eventually loaded up our car and took the alcan south to lake stevens washington where i finished school when finding out id come from alaska people asked me if i used to live in an igloo and have sled dogs to which i would answer yes yes i did like johnny cash said never let the truth get in the way of a good story speaking of great stories killer segway chris im proud to have executive produced this amazing documentary alaskan nets which is premiering at the santa barbara filmfestival like the basketball players in our doc i know what its like to live in a small town defined by high school sports and supported by local blue collar industry i didnt play basketball i was a wrestler and football player lake stevens has a string of state championships and i know first hand the pressures that come with carrying that legacy into a season this wonderful doc examines how small town expectations can like the weight of the whole world on a young mans shoulders i know the power a team has to unite a community to lift a kid up allow him or her to be part of something bigger than themselves to build character im so proud of our documentary alaskan nets it is a story of hope one which shines a light on an extraordinary group of kids and illuminates a corner of the world that otherwise might not be seen im excited to present metlakatla to the rest of the world if we look around we realize were going through a dark period and i believe people need stories like thesestories that dont shy away from the hardships we all face every day that ultimately uplift and inspire us to persevere and never lose hope
