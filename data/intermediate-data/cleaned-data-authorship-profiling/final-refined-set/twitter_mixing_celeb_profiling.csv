8,Tim @<user> thanks for hosting us for this It was truly a blast # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty <url><sep>. But first Ill make time for the Nevermind # TimsListeningParty because @<user> is one of my biggest influences and that is one of my favorite albums of all time Its an honor to be doing this the same day as them<sep>. Wow its been so long since I remembered some of these songsthis was so fun you guys now time to get back into the studio and keep moving on the newest stuff # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty<sep>. I still write with Luisfer to this day and its one of the times when I feel the most free Just him me and an acoustic guitar # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty <url><sep>. Moody guitars slides the lyrics of that song also makes use of a lot of hyperbole I guess Im a hyperbolic person when it comes to love Or in general Ha # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty<sep>. Que Me Quedes Tu was a love song I did with Luisfer Ochoa my longtime collaborator from Pies Descalzos to today That song very much has the sound of what Luisfer and I do together # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty <url><sep>. I was using the writing device of personification but in the opposite way instead of making an object or an animal into a person I did the contrary # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty<sep>. Poem to a Horsethis was me at the height of poetic hyperbole Essentially I was comparing a love interest to a horsewho couldnt appreciate what he had before him # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty <url><sep>. Its a song that has stood the test of time really wellI didnt perform it on this last tour but I might have to bring it back Its so nice to hear it again # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty <url><sep>. Te Dejo Madrid is one of the few Spanishlanguage songs from Laundry Serviceand its still one of the most fun to perform In Madrid especially # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty<sep>. @<user> BrendanDrums has been with me for almost my entire career and we still do things together like Girl Like Me but this is one of the first we did just me and him # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty <url><sep>. Fool is a song that I wrote with my drummer @<user> # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty <url><sep>. That tour the Tour of the Mongoose was my biggest tour yet and we had so much fun It was incredible for me to be able to perform to so many people in countries Id never even been to before # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty <url><sep>. Ready For The Good Times was one of the most fun for me to perform on tourthere was a dance that went with it that I really enjoyed # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty <url><sep>. The One was the last single off of Laundry Service The power ballad Shakira lol # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty<sep>. Rules was the song where I first performed playing drums on tour I had played drums before but that was the first song where I played them onstage # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty<sep>. It was one of the only times I actually listened to the label about which song to put out and when He convinced me # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty<sep>. When I played my music for the label Tommy Mottola went crazy for that song I wanted Objection to be the first single but I was totally wrongand he was totally right # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty <url><sep>. I was in a moment where I was in love with Latin folkloric music and I wanted something that honored that # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty<sep>. Whenever came out of me wanting to do a song with Andean sounds and instruments like the pan flute and the bombo leguero # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty <url><sep>. I was a huge fan of Herb but after that shoot I dont think he was a huge fan of mine because I took 7 hours in hair and makeup before shootingI was nervous ok # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty<sep>. Underneath was another of my first songs written in Englishwe did the video with Herb Ritts an iconic photographer whose black and white images I really loved and who I was dying to work with # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty <url><sep>. I wanted to do a tango because at the time I was dating an Argentinian and was learning the dance and was immersed in the Argentine culture # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty<sep>. Objection was the very first song I wrote in English on a mattress in the bedroom of my Miami apartment with a thesaurus in hand when I could barely speak the language # LaundryService20 # TimsListeningParty <url><sep>. Hola a todos Excited to sit down and listen to # LaundryService20 with you on its 20th birthdayits been a long time since I heard this album from top to bottom thanks @<user> TimBurgess @<user> for hosting OK lets all press play now # TimsListeningParty <url><sep>.

Ive now received so many death threats I could paper the house with them and I havent stopped speaking out Perhaps and Im just throwing this out there the best way to prove your movement isnt a threat to women is to stop stalking harassing and threatening us 8X<sep>. I have to assume that @<user> @<user> and @<user> thought doxxing me would intimidate me out of speaking up for womens sexbased rights They should have reflected on the fact that 78<sep>. None of these women are protected in the way I am They and their families have been put into a state of fear and distress for no other reason than that they refuse to uncritically accept that the sociopolitical concept of gender identity should replace that of sex 68<sep>. but whove contacted me to relate their experiences have been subject to campaigns of intimidation which range from being hounded on social media the targeting of their employers all the way up to doxing and direct threats of violence including rape 58<sep>. Over the last few years Ive watched appalled as women like Allison Bailey Raquel Sanchez Marion Miller Rosie Duffield Joanna Cherry Julie Bindel Rosa Freedman Kathleen Stock and many many others including women who have no public profile 48<sep>. I implore those people who retweeted the image with the address still visible even if they did so in condemnation of these peoples actions to delete it 38<sep>.

Got to get back to my chapter now but to all the people sending me beautiful kind funny and supportive messages thank you so much Wish I had time to answer all of you but Strike and Robin are at a tricky stage of their investigation so I need to drop a few clues<sep>. Yes but now hundreds of trans activists have threatened to beat rape assassinate and bomb me Ive realised that this movement poses no risk to women whatsoever <url><sep>. To be fair when you cant get a woman sacked arrested or dropped by her publisher and cancelling her only made her book sales go up theres really only one place to go <url><sep>. @<user> @<user> But I know why youre saying it Sisters<sep>. @<user> @<user> Thank you so much Anthony Ive had many messages saying the same thing Fear of a name etc<sep>. @<user> @<user> Ive had messages like this from a lot trans people Toni and it means so much to me I know very well that the pornposters dont represent you Thank you for being so brave and decent<sep>. @<user> @<user> Right back at you Stella xxx<sep>. @<user> I hope you arent just surviving but thriving xxx<sep>. @<user> @<user> And together we will win<sep>. @<user> @<user> Maria that means everything xxx<sep>. @<user> @<user> Thank you Claire and solidarity as always Youve been in these squalid trenches yourself as I know x<sep>. @<user> @<user> But people like you make it all better Thank you<sep>. @<user> @<user> We do Nell Sending you a massive hug xxxxxx<sep>. @<user> @<user> @<user> @<user> Youre a beacon of decency and kindness Sophie thank you x<sep>. @<user> @<user><sep>. @<user> @<user> @<user> If I took happy to ignore paedophilia out of this persons Tweet and posted it next to their picture would that be ok Tom <url><sep>. @<user> @<user> I saw that A crack team arrived out of nowhere to try and shut down all the porn as quickly as possible Thank you so much to all of you It really helped<sep>. @<user> @<user> That makes me so happy thank you<sep>. @<user> @<user> Best thing I could possibly hear Mary thank you<sep>. @<user> @<user> For me too Oh for an edit button<sep>. @CenderGrit @no1guncle 💕,F,jk_rowling
32,"@<user> Especially when I dont post my family because we as a family DONT WANT fans going on their pages Most of my family I dont even follow just so that ppl dont know their accounts If they wanted that kind of attention from my fans Id post them and tag them They dont<sep>. Super cuteeeeeee <url><sep>. Youre now on that list <url><sep>. Then cool I thought he was a girl for the last 5 months so I really dont think it makes a difference <url><sep>. Iam getting another rabbit tho but we are adopting one and Smokey will pick based on who he gets along with so Hopefully he doesnt like the ugly girls<sep>. @<user> No but you just seem like the fun police thats all<sep>. Not you policing where I do my day dreaming for a fake dog Im never buying lmao <url><sep>. Am I the only person who fully looks at puppies online knowing they 10000 have no intention of buying one Every other day It hits 11pm and BOOM I got ta window shop for puppies<sep>. @<user> The cute ones I dont wan na be no sea hag Hahaha<sep>. @<user> And I pulled it up in 5 seconds Conspiracy about our frog gills ended Although I do wan na be a mermaid just like everyone else<sep>. I love you guys so much but please read the paper hiccups arent from us having hills and they never concluded that Always READ the source paper guys <url><sep>. Why Is evolution a scary subject or Is it that it comes from this original paper listing it as one of many hypothesis reasons given and then the internet used it for click bait because they know you wont actually read and fishes are cool Here it is <url> <url><sep>. Told you your shits broken <url> <url><sep>. @<user> Naur<sep>. Your internet is broken again <url><sep>. Ive had the hiccups for 57 years<sep>. @<user> @<user> @<user> @<user> @<user> Thankyou for saying this Im happy to see Im not the only one who thinks its overstepping personal boundaries<sep>. @<user> @<user> @<user> @<user> Exactly Thankyou for understanding<sep>. @<user> @<user> Love you<sep>. I love seeing all the kids together <url><sep>. How many of you are actually deep frying a full turkey tho I<sep>. My moms coming to visit tomorrow amp im so excited for her to see how big onyx is now She hasnt been able to visit since his bday<sep>. Its a rabbit can you relax <url><sep>. Turns out our rabbit is actually a boy Luckily Smokey works as a name either way<sep>. Karmas a bitch Lmao<sep>. This is extremely cute <url><sep>. @<user> Are you in a mask If so you should feel a lot less anxiety Just keep your mask on and make sure to clean your hands when you exit<sep>. Haha thats how I felt when I wrote over this beat I was like am I about to go full yee haw on this beat <url><sep>. I dont think so Ive never heard of anyone paying for them regardless of origin <url><sep>. Its free in the USA <url><sep>. Iam an immigrant we have to have a long list of vaccinations before being granted a green card Doesnt matter if you already them they do a blood test and if your antibodies are too low for certain vaccines you have to redo them so Im pretty familiar with the concept <url><sep>. with that said I will keep being vaccinated for Covid as long as its actively being spread in my community because thats the best way I can help stop it spreading and you should too<sep>. Lets get into that depends how active Covid is in cases example Measles vaccineyou need a shot every 10 years to remain effective but most ppl dont go back because its not something in the community being spread actively therefore not high on your list of shit to do <url><sep>. If you have your vaccination more than 6 months ago you should book an appointment for a booster shot to make sure you still have enough antibodies in your system for it to be effective <url><sep>. If youve been vaccinated as time passes your immunity declines and youll need a booster vaccination to restore the antibodies in your body to a level that gives you real protection I was vaccinated early April so I just got my booster shot yesterday <url><sep>. Its been more than 24hrs now and Im not feeling anything so I think Im in the clear <url><sep>. Thankyou but I dont feel bad Lol <url><sep>. I said Id give an update about getting the booster shot so here it is Nothing happened besides my arm being a bit sore I feel totally normal<sep>. @<user> Im feeling normal still but lets see how it goes when I wake up Honestly Id be surprised if I have any side effects because it takes ALOT for me to be run down<sep>. I dont think theres a person alive on this planet happier than Britney Spears today amp the thought of that really makes me smile<sep>. Just got my booster shot<sep>. I definitely will but all my decorations wont be here yet Once its 100 done Ill share with you guys <url><sep>. Im putting up my Christmas tree tomorrow Fuck it<sep>. Thankyou <url><sep>.

I make them at every event and theres never any left so clearly its not just me <url><sep>. This is BEYOND <url><sep>. @<user> Its something that the eventvenue is in charge of not the artist I cant speak for this festival because the artist was the creator of the festival but for a normal concert thats not under the umbrella of ppl an artist hires<sep>. Honestly All ages means ALL ages ANY age has the right to expect a safe space or at least the option to exit safely Lets Stop shaming the victimsThe families are victims too <url><sep>. I hate to log on and see so many people shaming that poor little boys family for taking him to an ALL AGES musical festival. 
I’ve seen so many children with parents enjoying festivals over the years.
none were injured. 
Let’s not victim blame the family, please! 🤍",F,iggyazalea

44,Thanks so much to everybody for watching the first season of the iCarly revival You guys are the best and we cant wait for you to see Season 2<sep>. Has anybody ever been told I love you by two guys at the same time I definitely havent Carly handled it better than I probably wouldve # iCarlyFinale<sep>. I love the scene with Spencer and Millicent investing in Freddies app Millicent has a hard shell but she definitely loves Freddie and you always see it when it really counts # iCarlyFinale<sep>. @<user> and I had fun dressing up and wearing flower crowns when we sit on a suitcase and talk about our complicated love lives We decided to do valley girl voices at the end of the scene for Theyre so cute Theyre best friends So cute<sep>. For the treehouse scene where it falls out of the tree during the storm our crew actually built a set that was like a ride at an amusement park A remote controlled the entire set and it flew from side to side on a spring # iCarlyFinale<sep>. We got to make smores and eat them in between takes around the campfire Ive never actually been camping and it was my first time making smores # iCarlyFinale<sep>. George the Bra that tells Ghost Stories was one of my favorite old skits from the original iCarly so I was excited the writers had Beau mention it during the campfire scene # iCarlyFinale<sep>. I think its so cute watching Spencer and Millicent work together in secret to try to help Freddie sell his app # iCarlyFinale<sep>. When Beau offers Carly coke with lime the writers put that in because everyone knows how much I love drinking coke in real life # iCarlyFinale<sep>. Every time @<user> said the line helluva Bidet I couldnt not laugh # iCarlyFinale<sep>. I actually loved the luxury treehouse that Beau gets to stay in at Webicon I wish I could stay in one in real life # iCarlyFinale<sep>. @<user> and I had a lotta fun picking up the smallest twigs and really playing up having no idea how to camp or survive in the wilderness during the scene with the compass<sep>. I actually ate a few of the marshmallows off of Dutchs performance dress # iCarlyFinale<sep>. We switched the opening titles back to the full version of the theme song for the # iCarlyFinale and I asked if we could add in the old shot from the original title sequence where Carly throws her blue cowboy hat in the air<sep>. During the opening scene where the group is packing to go to Webicon I kept messing up the everybody hands in moment I dont think Id ever been in charge of a group huddle before and it was hard to get the timing right<sep>.

71,"This Veterans Day I want to share Tom Voutsoss story He served in the US Marine Corps and has continued to live a life dedicated to public service Through @<user> hes helping hardworking folks buy their own home <url><sep>. To every veteran and their family we thank you for your service and sacrifice to our country <url><sep>. @<user> SpeakerPelosi and these members of Congress are making it clear that the United States is back and will continue to lead the way on climate change We would not have met our Paris goals without them and now theyre working to do even more <url><sep>. Young people have more at stake in the fight against climate change than anyone else I had a chance to talk with some young people who are helping lead the fight and could not be more impressed by their courage creativity and persistence They give me hope <url><sep>. If you care about climate change @<user> new book Speed amp Scale An Action Plan for Solving Our Climate Crisis Now offers concrete steps that we can all take to make a difference <url><sep>. Thats why if were going to act on the scale thats required climate change cant be seen as another opportunity to score political points We need everybody And young people in particular have an opportunity to make a real difference<sep>. But once again progress is partial Most nations have failed to be as ambitious as they need to be and the escalation of ambition that we anticipated in Paris six years ago has not been uniformly realized<sep>. The good news is that countries around the world recognize this is a decisive decade if we want to avoid a climate disaster and are setting important goals for 2030 Theyve also promised to help countries move away from fossil fuels and deal with the effects of climate change<sep>. I spoke at COP26 in Glasgow about whats happened in the six years since the Paris Agreement and how much further we still need to go to control climate changehttpstcoan9xxwrOQC<sep>. Weve done some important work since the Paris Agreement was signed six year ago but were still nowhere near where we need to be on climate Watch live from # COP26in Glasgow as I talk about the steps we can take to combat climate changehttpstcofpoGbnNehm<sep>. Five years ago the Paris Agreement went into effect Paris provided an important framework in the fight against climate change but it wasnt enough Thats why Ill be speaking in Glasgow on Monday about the road ahead and what young people in particular can do to help <url><sep>. Visit <url> to find your polling location And if you have any questions call the voter hotline at 8333368683<sep>. Today is Election Day and so much of what we care about is on the ballotfrom access to health care to bringing our economy back from COVID19 to combating climate change We need everybody going out to vote So make a plan to vote and make your voice heard<sep>. Signing the Paris Agreement to fight climate change was one of my proudest moments in office But it was always a foundation to build on As world leaders gather for COP26 I shared some reflections on the road to Paris and the young activists who are pushing us further <url><sep>. In a country as large and diverse as ours progress can often feel frustrating and slow with small victories accompanied by frequent setbacks But once in a while its still possible to take a giant leap forward Thats what the Build Back Better framework represents <url><sep>. Climate change isnt a distant environmental issueits already having an immediate impact on our lives including huge national security implications as more communities come under stresshttpstcowLnJgynwCs<sep>. When you look at the history of big social movements theyre usually started and sustained by young people who put in the work to make it happen As we look to COP26 Im inspired by the young people using their voices in the fight against climate change <url><sep>. It was great to be back in New Jersey Theres too much at stake in this election to sit it out Lets keep New Jersey moving forward by reelecting @<user> and Democrats up and down the ballot Make a plan to vote earlyand get everyone you know to do the same <url><sep>. Virginians delivered for me twice and now Im asking them to do it again by electing @<user> as their next governor Every bit of progress in Virginia is at stake in this electionand theres no time to waste Make a plan to vote early at <url> <url><sep>. Some of the most important changes often start in state legislatures Thats why Im proud to support these candidates for the Virginia state legislature I hope youll join me and the @<user> in giving them your vote <url><sep>. Glad I had a chance to talk with our new champs I really am proud of this team and their work this season <url><sep>. At a time when voting rights are being rolled back the Freedom to Vote Act would strengthen our democracy and give more Americans a voice Thats why the Senate should do the right thing and protect what so many generations fought so hard to secure<sep>. It was great speaking with the @<user> Advisory Council and hearing more about the work theyre doing to make a difference in the lives of boys and young men of color across the country <url><sep>. General Colin Powell understood what was best in this country and tried to bring his own life career and public statements in line with that ideal Michelle and I will always look to him as an example of what Americaand Americanscan and should be <url><sep>. Congratsto our new WNBA champs @<user> I couldnt be prouder of this team they worked hard for this moment and have made our city proud <url><sep>. Today we lost an icon with the passing of Timuel Black Over his 102 years Tim was many things a veteran historian author educator civil rights leader and humanitarian Michelle and I send our thoughts to his family and everyone who loved him <url><sep>. I was deeply saddened to learn about the passing of General Ray Odierno after a battle with cancer He devoted his life to serving this country and for that I will always be grateful Michelle and I send our thoughts to his wife Linda and their children <url><sep>. Congratulations to Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov This award is a tribute to their extraordinary courage and the enduring value of factbased journalism and freedom of expression which is under threat in far too many places today <url><sep>. And of course Im excited for my @<user> to be back in the playoffs Its going to be hard to top a walkoff home run on the Field of Dreams but if any team can do it its this one Go Sox <url><sep>. Its always good to be from Chicago but this year is especially sweet Congratulations to the @<user> for making it to the WNBA finals and to the legend @<user> for making all of us proud Well be rooting for you <url><sep>. If we dont stand up for democracy well see this type of gerrymandering happen in even more states Its why @<user> is fighting for # FairMaps And its why the Senate must pass the Freedom to Vote Act to protect our communities from partisan gerrymandering<sep>. And in Georgia Republicans released a congressional map that decreases the voting power of communities of color including African Americans in a historically Black district and ignores how the state has changed<sep>. In Texas for example Republicans recently passed a law making voting harder especially for people of color Now theyre advancing a new congressional map thats tilted in their favor and doesnt reflect the states growth <url><sep>. Right now state legislatures across the country are setting new boundaries for state legislative and congressional districts And in many states Republicans are drawing maps that allow them to hold onto power<sep>. Our latest production from Higher Ground Ada Twist Scientist is now on Netflix Based on the book series the show will continue the work we started at the White House Science Fair We hope it inspires more young people to discover science and use their imagination to create <url><sep>. Happy anniversary Miche Over the past 29 years Ive loved watching the world get to know you not just as a daughter of the South Side but as a mother lawyer executive author First Lady and my best friend I cant imagine life without you <url><sep>. Happy 97th birthday President Carter Thank you for the extraordinary example of lifelong service that youve set for all of us<sep>. Today we officially broke ground on the Obama Presidential Center on the South Side of Chicago Michelle and I cant imagine a better investment in the city we love and generations of young leaders who will help create change <url><sep>. Michelle and I couldnt be more excited to officially < <break> > ground on the Obama Presidential Center on the South Side of Chicago Tune in livehttpstcoO4VvzEgwIx<sep>. Michelle and I had fun surprising some of the hardworking women from the Chicago Women of Trades Were grateful for the work theyre doingnot only to build the Obama Presidential Center but also to make it easier for more people to follow their example <url><sep>. It was great meeting our newest class of @<user> Scholars at @<user> Young leaders like them are the source of my hope and I believe they will power a brighter future for all of us <url><sep>. Chicago will always be an important place to @<user> and me which is why were excited to celebrate the virtual ground < <break> > ing for the Obama Presidential Center in Chicagonext weekIts been a long time coming and we cant wait to see this project come to life <url><sep>. If we want to give our children and grandchildren a brighter future the wealthiest Americans and large corporations must pay their fair share in taxes <url><sep>. The repeal of Dont Ask Dont Tell allowed these two Marines to be true to themselves while serving in our military Listen to their story <url><sep>. Ten years ago today we repealed Dont Ask Dont Tell Today our military is stronger and our country is safer because patriotic Americans no longer have to live a lie in order to defend the country they love <url><sep>. Wishing my friend @<user> the best in Canadas upcoming election Justin has been an effective leader and strong voice for democratic values and Im proud of the work we did together<sep>. The Freedom to Vote Act just introduced in the Senate would strengthen our democracy by making it easier for people to vote and harder for politicians and special interests to drown out the voices of ordinary Americans I support it and every Senator should do the same<sep>. Many of the refugees fleeing Afghanistan stood by America and risked everything for a chance at a better life With the launch of <url> we can support our new Afghan neighbors and reaffirm our common humanity I hope youll join us <url><sep>. Today we honor the nearly 3000 men women and children who died on September 11 2001 and the heroes who have always run towards danger to do whats right Lets never forget that day and lets never take them for granted <url><sep>. It was great speaking with @<user> Murthy and the COVID19 Community Corps volunteers across the country whove been spending their time and energy encouraging their communities to get vaccinated Their work is making a difference and will help us end this pandemic <url><sep>. California Youve got a big choice to make by September 14 and everything is on the line Your vote could be the difference between protecting our kids or putting them at risk helping Californians recover or taking us backwards Vote no on the Republican recall<sep>. Great memories of an important day 31 million people now have health insuranceand the peace of mind that comes with itthanks to the Affordable Care Act Now @<user> is committed to making it even stronger through his Build Back Better plan <url><sep>. The pandemic has devastated communities everywhere But the young leaders in our newest class of @<user> Scholars studying at @<user> and @<user> give me hope for a better future Congratulations Scholars <url><sep>. Labor Day is about honoring folks like Maurice Harrisa devoted husband and father of five who has spent his career working in the trades in Chicago Hell soon help build our Obama Presidential Center Heres his incredible story <url><sep>. This Labor Day lets honor all the working men and women who make this country what it isand the American labor movement that has helped protect them especially during this pandemic<sep>. Michelle and I are thinking of everyone affected by Hurricane Ida and were grateful to the first responders doing heroic work Here are some ways to support those in need <url><sep>. May God bless the memory of those we lost and protect those who remain in harms way<sep>. Our hearts go out to the families who lost a loved one and to everyone continuing the mission in Kabul Were also thinking of the families of the Afghans who died many of whom stood by America and were willing to risk everything for a chance at a better life<sep>. As president nothing was more painful than grieving with the loved ones of Americans who gave their lives serving our country As President Biden said these service members are heroes who have been engaged in a dangerous selfless mission to save the lives of others<sep>. Like so many of you Michelle and I were heartbroken to hear about the terrorist attack outside the Kabul airport that killed and wounded so many US service members as well as Afghan men women and children<sep>. Yesterday the House passed the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act that will help Americans everywhere make their voices heard Now the Senate needs to follow the Houses lead Call your Senators and ask them to do the right thing Our democracy is on the line <url><sep>. The Olympics may be over, but the @Paralympics are just getting started. Many of the athletes on @TeamUSA have traveled amazing journeys to reach the top of their sport, and I’ll be cheering them on. Hope you will, too. https://t.co/SOxC1B4Df5",M,barackobama

Thank you @<user> This 1B partnership between @<user> Energy Catalyst @<user> and @<user> will help accelerate the deployment of critical climate technologies Im grateful for our continued collaboration <url><sep>. Encouraged to discuss with PM @<user> on the sidelines of # COP26 the potential of further investments in science innovation and transformative agriculture RampD as an important foundation for mitigating impact of climate change on small landowning farmers @<user> @<user> <url><sep>. One of my top priorities here at # COP26 is making sure that the world prioritizes scaling clean technology innovation Here is the message I delivered to world leaders earlier today <url><sep>. In addition to investments in reducing emissions to slow climate change we need to help those already impacted by climate change adapt <url><sep>. By bringing the world together at # COP26 we can find more ways to accelerate the development and adoption of the clean technologies we need to reach netzero emissions <url><sep>. At this years UN Climate Conference innovation will take center stage and Im optimistic about the road ahead <url><sep>. I hope Congress passes the Build Back Better Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act fast We cant wait another moment <url><sep>. Good to see this commitment by @<user> to help ensure from the outset that molnupiravir a potential treatment for COVID19 will be available to many more nations <url><sep>. To avoid a climate disaster we need young peoples ideas and energy College and university students anywhere in the world can download my book for free <url> <url><sep>. Its great to see the strong commitment of partners like @<user> and the dedication on the front line to eradicate polio On # WorldPolioDay we recognize progress and acknowledge that the fight continues <url><sep>. This week any college or university student anywhere in the world can download my book How to Avoid a Climate Disaster for free <url><sep>. This # WorldPolioDay you can support Shumaila and other polio workers by donating to @<user> fight against polio Our foundation is giving a 2to1 match to every donation Learn more <url><sep>. The world needs heroes like Shumaila Rehmani Im inspired by the impact shes making in her community to save lives and help # EndPolio <url><sep>. Ive been binging geography videos lately I liked this one where Geography King explains several really fascinating quirks of US geography including why it doesnt actually rain as much as people think in my hometown <url><sep>. India has administered 1 billion vaccine doses a testament to Indias innovation ability to manufacture at scale and the efforts of millions of health workers backed by CoWIN Congratulations @<user> @<user> @<user> @<user> <url><sep>. The world is so close to ending polio thanks to heroes like Shumaila Rehmani <url> # WorldPolioDay <url><sep>. Our funding is only part of the solution More donors will need to step up to make sure molnupiravir is available to all as quickly as possible<sep>. Everyone deserves equitable access to healthcare Thats why we engaged partners like @<user> and @<user> to find more affordable safe materials that generic manufacturers can use to produce medicines at a lower cost<sep>. Weve done this before In 2017 the @<user> worked with partners and generic suppliers to bring improved HIV therapies to more than 18 million people in lowerincome countries<sep>. If were going to end the acute phase of the pandemic lifesaving drugs like molnupiravir must be available to everyone who needs them <url><sep>. By investing in direct air capture clean hydrogen longduration energy storage and sustainable aviation fuel well create a new industrial revolution that will power the global clean energy economy <url><sep>. Earlier today I attended the # GlobalInvestmentSummit where we announced @<user> Energy Catalysts latest partnership to accelerate climate technologies Thanks to the UK government amp @<user> for taking bold action <url><sep>. Im grateful to have joined @<user> today to highlight the important work that @<user> Energy Catalyst is doing to accelerate clean technologies Our partnership with the UK will be critical to building the netzero economy <url><sep>. Jenn and Nayel its impossible to put into words how happy it makes me to see you filled with joy on your wedding day Im so proud of you both for everything youve accomplished in your lives so far and everything you will do with your future together <url><sep>. Reaching net zero will take bold action and creativity and the first cohort of @<user> Energy Fellows makes me optimistic that we can propel a new industrial revolution <url><sep>. I wrote about two ways to achieve vaccine equity in the future If the world makes the right investments and decisions now we can make things better next time And maybe even make sure there is no next time at all <url><sep>. Still the disparities in access to the COVID19 vaccine are shocking and unjust Only 2 percent of people in lowincome countries have received any COVID19 vaccines And the gap may be getting even larger as richworld governments buy up extra doses to serve as booster shots<sep>. Inequity in health is not new Each year more than 5 million childrenalmost entirely in low and middleincome countriesdie before their fifth birthday from mostly preventable diseases Reducing this gap has been the Gates Foundations top priority for more than 20 years<sep>. The pandemic has worsened inequities But its also shown the world whats possible when we come together Read why theres reason to be optimistic in our 2021 Goalkeepers Report <url><sep>. This work has been critical to our understanding of the causes and impacts of climate change Congratulations on this welldeserved recognition <url><sep>. What a fantastic leader Dr Collins has been The US is lucky to have amazing scientists and public health professionals like him He leaves an incredible legacy <url><sep>. Thanks as always @<user> for the thoughtful conversation I look forward to continuing to talk with business leaders governments and activists at # COP26 about how we can work together to avoid a climate disaster <url><sep>. Stephanie and Victoria had no plans to go to college until they met Valerie from @<user> This organization helped them realize their dreams <url> <url><sep>.

Congratulations @<user> on the national launch of Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission This digital health infrastructure will help ensure equitable accessible healthcare delivery and accelerate progress on Indias health goals @<user> @<user> <url><sep>. What if your smart phone could detect Alzheimers @<user> Diagnostics Accelerator is working to make this a reality <url><sep>. India is a great example of a country that has invested in its capacity Today 23rds of all the worlds children receive a vaccine that was made in India <url><sep>. Expanding the geography of vaccine manufacturing to better meet vaccine needs both for pandemics and routine immunization is a critical task <url><sep>. Thanks for having me on the show, @JKCorden!

I appreciate this thank you Proper Twelve has always done amazing in blind taste tests I was speaking on this the other day Depending who the person is bias one way or the other can take over honest opinion I am a big fan of and always confident in blind taste testing <url><sep>. My whiskey is the smoothest on the market bar none But I still do not recommend to drink fully straight Onetwo cubes of ice is perfect The ice opens the flavor inside the glass Think of the liquid as a fist in the barrel you need slight dilution to open it Slight now <url><sep>. I do indeed Forged in Dublin @<user> <url> <url><sep>. @<user> Get the crew and jump a flight Aaron The Scots are always welcome<sep>. Id say the goat cheese bon bons to start A taste bomb Then our Irish steak on a stone for main To drink then Id have a Forged Stout and a Proper Twelve on the rocks Dessert Id go for The Black Forge Mess with more Forged Stout and Proper Twelve to finish What a place <url><sep>. Hello El Salvador fans <url><sep>. consolation<sep>.

Same leg same spot I attribute it to why I wasnt in as much shock as ChrisAnderson where I knew something may happen in advance Chris was upset with my quote Felt I was aiming at him I was not If any constellation to my reaction It was because id a heads up it may snap <url><sep>. His head was sorer my leg was sorer I feel good on that Not to say his leg wasnt busted either tho I had that thigh well minced I feel its just simply not settled yet Is the fairest response I can give <url><sep>. In my last camp Id a severely damaged left leg Many of my sessions consisted of starting in open guard bottom And staying there Full rounds remaining on bottom I was beating people up until they backed away from me It then translated to the fight True story @<user> <url><sep>. I could sponsor him Hed be highly thankful as well as grateful and work extremely hard to assist in my companies growth Its a tough business man In fact you know what Im gon na sponsor myself 12 million dollars right now this second And push all the companies <url><sep>.

@<user> there was definitely some questionable and possibly homophobic editing<sep>. @<user> it would have been nice to have more of us hanging out than the explainy transitions but i think it was fun<sep>. @<user> i have certainly been<sep>. @<user> yes we filmed for two whole days so i think it could have easily been an hour show<sep>. @<user> i thought it was an unrealistic dream so i went to law school and then got caught up in the whole internet thing<sep>. @<user> to be fair i had only seen phils house and he thought wed get merked wearing skinny jeans if we went out<sep>. @<user> im still in the oven<sep>. @<user> and to think they werent interested back then<sep>. @<user> like everything was very small because i am now very long<sep>. @<user> are you saying my teen years of loitering behind infrastructure isnt exciting<sep>. @<user> it was the hottest day of the year in rossendale which made it beautiful and sweaty<sep>. @<user> there was some nice cement and grass<sep>. @<user> every person in the crew tried it for an hour and he is the only one that got the axe in the board hes an apex predator<sep>. @<user> if it made you smile i a glad i did it thank you<sep>. @<user> my peak moment in the english langauge and sport<sep>. dan and phil go back to the places they pretended to be straight <url><sep>. @<user> yes same very debatable<sep>. @<user> this entire

craps<sep>. @<user> definitely too many expectations for midday what are we supposed to have achieved<sep>. im not really a morning person but also not a night person so i guess im just trying to say im always useless and tired<sep>. @<user> this is all just one big intervention for me<sep>. @<user> yes whatever information they are getting from me will be totally useless and probably terrifying<sep>. @<user> i will cause everyone to deactivate and we will have world peace<sep>. @<user> you would be disturbed by how utterly offline some of these people are maybe thats what draws me to them<sep>. @<user> if you arent calling out grandma whats the point<sep>. @<user> they used to punch me and now i want them step on my neck<sep>. @<user> scared or hopeful im not sure<sep>. the only reason i havent deactivated facebook is to stalk school friends that i fantasise about reuniting and hooking up with despite the fact they have full lives and havent thought about me in years so i deserve to have my data sold tbh<sep>. @<user> months of practice for a two minute shitpost thank you and goodbye<sep>. @<user> skin routine in shambles but piano polish game strong<sep>. @<user>

your name is moderately long to type so thats talent right there<sep>. @<user> apparently politicians really do panic and do things when theres a petition so heres hoping for some positive peer pressure<sep>. you souldnt have to wait until you are in a crisis to get helpplease add your name to this open letter to @<user> for the government to prioritise mental health in the upcoming spending review it would literally save lives <url> <url><sep>. @<user> waiting for dawn of chromatica yellow flannel<sep>. @<user> watching 10 streamers in separate tabs and pretending im having a party<sep>. @<user> the ratio is the people sat either side judging your conversation<sep>. @<user> healthy attachments are when were charging our phones rights<sep>. @<user> its all of us all the time its too late<sep>. @<user> yes maybe i can fix them or they < <break> > my neck either way it works out<sep>. @<user> i mean its just everyone i follow<sep>. what if we had a parasocial relationship and i

Despus de haberlo hablado con el equipo y familia se ha tomado esta decisin y creo que es el camino a seguir para intentar recuperarme y recuperarme bienEs un ao que me he perdido cosas que me importan mucho como Wimbledon como son las Olimpiadas<sep>.

The Olympic Games always meant a lot and they were always a priority as a Sports person I found the spirit that every sports person in the world wants to live I personally had the chance to live 3 of them and had the honor to be the flag bearer for my country<sep>. I want to send a special message to my fans around the world to those in the United Kingdom and Japan in particular<sep>. Sport prevention of any kind of excess in my body is a very important factor at this stage of my career in order to try to keep fighting for the highest level of competition and titles<sep>. The fact that there has only been 2 weeks between RG and Wimbledon didnt make it easier on my body to recuperate after the always demanding clay court season They have been two months of great effort and the decision I take is focused looking at the mid and long term<sep>. The goal is to prolong my career and continue to do what makes me happy that is to compete at the highest level and keep fighting for those professional and personal goals at he maximum level of competition<sep>. Hi all I have decided not to participate at this years Championships at Wimbledon and the Olympic Games in Tokyo Its never an easy decision to take but after listening to my body and discuss it with my team I understand that it is the right decision<sep>. Los JJOO han significado mucho en mi carrera y siempre fueron una prioridad como deportista encontr el ambiente que todo deportista quiere sentir al menos una vez y personalmente tuve la suerte de vivirlos intensamente en tres ocasiones y ademas ser el abanderado de mi pas<sep>. En estos momentos de mi carrera como deportista una parte importante es la prevencin de cualquier tipo de excesos en mi cuerpo que pudieran impedir seguir luchando en el medio y largo plazo por los ttulos<sep>. El hecho de que haya solo dos semanas entre Roland Garros y Wimbledon este ao no ha ayudado a que mi cuerpo pueda recuperar de la siempre exigente temporada de tierra batida Han sido dos meses de un gran esfuerzo y la decisin que tomo va enfocada al medio y largo plazo<sep>. Es una decisin que nunca resulta fcil de tomar Tras escuchar mi cuerpo y hablar con mi equipo entiendo que es la decisin acertada con el objetivo de alargar mi carrera deportiva y seguir haciendo lo que me hace feliz competir al mximo nivel y seguir luchando<sep>. Hola a todos Quiero comunicaros que he decidido no participar en la prxima edicin de Wimbledon que se disputar del 28 de junio al 11 de julio Tampoco jugar los Juegos Olmpicos previstos finalmente del 24 al 30 de julio<sep>. Very excited to experience the Kia # EV6 The design is really inspiring and I think lots of you will like itMuy contento con probar el Kia # EV6 El diseo es verdaderamente inspirador y creo que os gustar # Kia # MovementThatInspires # KiaEV6 <url><sep>.

160,"If we put the # Gospel at the centre and bear witness to it with fraternal love we will be able to look to the future with hope whatever the tempests great or small we may experience today<sep>. It is my hope and prayer that each of you can joyfully say With Jesus I too am a king I too reign as a living sign of the love of God of his compassion and his tenderness # ChristTheKing <url><sep>. Dear young friends Be free and authentic be the critical conscience of society Be passionate about truth so that with your dreams you can say My life is not captive to the mindset of the world I am free because I reign with Jesus for justice love and peace # WYD<sep>. The kingship of Jesus is completely different than that of the world He did not come to dominate but to serve He did not come amid signs of power but with the power of signs He is not like other kings but he is King for the others # ChristTheKing<sep>. Today Christs invitation to Paul is directed to every one of you young people Get up Do not remain on the ground feeling sorry for yourself Theres a mission waiting for you You too can testify to what Jesus has begun to accomplish in you<sep>. The way we relate to children the extent to which we respect their innate human dignity and fundamental rights expresses what kind of adults we are and want to be and what kind of society we want to build # WorldChildrensDay<sep>. Child labor is the exploitation of children It is the denial of their rights to health education harmonious growth to play to dream It means robbing children of their future and therefore humanity itself<sep>. Dear young people if our world is to arise it needs your strength your enthusiasm your passion <url><sep>. # Prayer is primarily listening and encountering God The problems of everyday life then do not become obstacles but appeals from God himself to listen to and encounter those who are in front of us The trials of life thus change into opportunities to grow in faith and charity<sep>. Saint Joseph you who came from the periphery help us change our vision and to take care of those persons who are discarded or are on the margins of society # GeneralAudience<sep>. Dialogue between members of different religions does not take place simply for diplomacy courtesy or tolerance The goal of dialogue is to establish friendship peace and harmony to share spiritual and moral values and experiences in a spirit of truth and love # DayForTolerance<sep>. I am grateful for all the initiatives of solidarity on the occasion of the # WorldDayOfThePoor I also invite you to repeat the strong moment of witness and prayer that we lived last Friday in Assisi <url><sep>. That is the word that makes hope blossom in the world and relieves the suffering of the poor tenderness We need to overcome the temptation to be concerned only about our own problems we need to grow tender before the tragedies of our world to share its pain<sep>. Let us bring an outlook of hope to our world Let us bring it with tenderness to the poor without judging them For there with them is Jesus because there in them is Jesus who awaits us # WorldDayOfThePoor <url><sep>. A person who is generous helpful meek patient not envious does not gossip brag or lack respect cf 1 Cor 1347 this is a person who builds Heaven on earth That person may not be noticed and yet what he or she does will not be lost because good lasts forever<sep>. What is it that gives solidity to life and will never end Saint Paul tells us Love never ends 1 Cor 138<sep>. We are called to discover Christ in the poor to lend our voice to their causes but also to be their friends to listen to them to understand them and to welcome the mysterious wisdom that God wants to communicate to us through them <url><sep>. It is time that the circle of indifference be broken so as to discover once again the beauty of encounter and dialogue<sep>. It is time that violence against women cease and that they be respected and not treated like bargaining chips<sep>. It is time to be scandalised once again before the reality of children who are starving reduced to slavery tossed about in the water in the aftermath of a shipwreck innocent victims of every sort of violence<sep>. It is time for sleeves to be rolled up so dignity can be restored by creating jobs<sep>. It is time that eyes be opened to see the state of inequality in which many families live<sep>. It is time that the poor be given back their voice because for too long their requests have remained unheard<sep>. Here at the Portiuncula Saint Francis welcomed Saint Clare the first brothers and many poor people who came to him Hospitality means to open the door the door of our house and the door of our heart and to allow the person who knocks to come in<sep>. There can not be a cooperation that generates peace without concrete collective dedication that promotes integral disarmament # ParisPeaceForum2021<sep>. It is time to develop a new form of universal solidarity that is grounded in fraternity love and mutual understanding one that values people over profit one that seeks new ways to understand development and progress # COP26<sep>. If we do not want to live life poorly let us ask for the grace to see Jesus in the poor to serve Jesus in the poor # SaintMartinOfTours<sep>. Faith in Christ in your heart is like Christ in the boat Saint Augustine We wake Christ up in our hearts and then we can contemplate things with his vision because He sees beyond the storm # GeneralAudience<sep>. Let us commit ourselves to fostering an education in fraternity so that the outbursts of hatred that would destroy that fraternity will not prevail The threat of antisemitism still lurking in Europe and elsewhere is a threat that must be defused<sep>. The world needs Christians who know how to demonstrate the beauty of the Gospel by the way they live who are weavers of dialogue models of fraternal life who bring the sweet fragrance of hospitality and solidarity who protect and safeguard life<sep>. Let us # PrayTogether for the people of # Ethiopia so sorely tried by the conflict that has lasted more than a year and has caused numerous victims and a serious humanitarian crisis I renew my appeal for fraternal harmony on the peaceful path of dialogue<sep>. In the # GospelOfTheDay Mk 123844 Jesus proposes the poor wideo as a teacher of faith the sound of her few coins is more beautiful than the grandiose offerings of the rich since they express a life sincerely dedicated to God with unconditional trust<sep>. Let us care for our common home and also for ourselves trying to eliminate the seeds of conflict greed indifference ignorance fear injustice insecurity and violence Humanity has never before had at its disposal so many means for achieving this goal # COP26 # EnvConflictDay<sep>. Consolation is a strength that does not come from ourselves but from the One who is with us Jesus the Godwithus Let us encourage ourselves with this certainty with Gods consolation And let us as the Sacred Heart for the grace of being able to console when it is our turn<sep>. Passion The Heart of Christ is an impassioned heart wounded by love torn open for us on the cross That tenderness and suffering that Heart reveals what Gods passion is man<sep>. Memory To remember means to return with the heart It is good for us to nurture our memory with those who have loved us taken care of us lifted us up The Heard of Jesus reminds us that whatever happens to us in life we are loved<sep>. Contemplating the Heart of Christ we can allow ourselves to be guided by three words memory passion and comfort<sep>. Being a member of the people of God is a gift a responsibility the responsibility of witnessing by our deeds not just our words to Gods wonderful works which once known help people to acknowledge his existence and to receive his salvation # Synod<sep>. May the protection of minors be more and more a concrete ordinary priority within the Churchs educational works May it be the promotion of an open trustworthy and reliable service in strict contrast to every form of domination betrayal of intimacy or silent complicity<sep>. Today before the mystery of death that has been redeemed let us ask for the grace of perceiving adversity with new eyes Let us ask for the strength to know how to live in humble and confident silence that awaits the Lords salvation without complaining and without grumbling<sep>. Let us # PrayTogether that people who suffer from depression or burnout will find support and a light that opens them up to life # PrayerIntention <url><sep>. When we are tempted to judge others badly we must rather reflect on our own weakness It is good to ask ourselves what drives us to correct a brother or a sister and if we are not in some way coresponsible for their mistake # GeneralAudience<sep>. Love is the supreme rule for following the path of Christ it makes us aware of our weakness and merciful and in solidarity with the difficulties and weaknesses of others # GeneralAudience<sep>. There is no time to wait Unfortunately there are too many people suffering from the environmental crisis Urgent and courageous action is needed along with the responsible preparation of a future in which humanity will be capable of taking care of itself and nature # COP26<sep>. To you who pass by think about your footsteps and your final step that it be peaceful These tombs are a message of peace Stop brother and sister stop Stop weapons makers stop<sep>. There is a mysterious solidarity in Christ between those who have already passed to the other life and we pilgrims in this one Our deceased loved ones continue to take care of us from Heaven They pray for us and we pray for them and we pray with them # Prayer # FaithfulDeparted<sep>. Do not be afraid to set your sights higher to allow yourself to be loved and liberated by God Do not be afraid to let yourself be guided by the Holy Spirit Holiness does not make you less human since it is an encounter between your weakness and the power of Gods grace<sep>. Do not be afraid of holiness It will take away none of your energy vitality or joy On the contrary you will become what the Father had in mind when he created you and you will be faithful to your deepest self # UniversalSanctification<sep>. Blessed be Jesus Christ the only Saviour of the world together with this immense flowering of saintly men and women who populate the earth and who have made their life a hymn to God # AllSaintsDay<sep>. The saints who often count for little in the eyes of the world are in reality the ones who sustain it not with the weapons of money and power but with the weapon of # prayer # AllSaintsDay<sep>. I am thinking about the population of Haiti who are living in extreme conditions I ask that all leaders of nations help this country not to leave it on its own How much suffering how much pain there is in that land Let us # PrayTogether for Haiti let us not abaondon them<sep>. This is a moment to dream big to rethink our priorities what we value what we want what we seek and replan our future committing to act in our daily life on what we have dreamed of The time to act and to act together is now # COP26<sep>. The # WordOfGod must be repeated made ones own safeguarded It must reach every aspect of life involve as Jesus says in the # GospelOfTheDay the entire heart the entire soul the entire mind all of our strength Mk 1228 It must resound within us<sep>. Let us build cities that while preserving their respective cultural and religious identity are open to differences and know how to promote them in the spirit of human fraternity # FratelliTutti # WorldCitiesDay<sep>. When we pray we never do so alone even if we do not think about it we are immersed in a majestic river of invocations that precedes us and proceeds after us # Prayer # CommunionOfSaints<sep>. Climate change can be faced with a renewed sense of shared responsibility for our world and an effective solidarity based on justice a sense of our common destiny and a recognition of the unity of our human family in Gods plan for the world # Faiths4COP26<sep>. We often do the bare minimum whereas Jesus invites us to do the maximum possible How many times are we satisfied with doing our duties the precepts a few prayers whereas God who gives us life asks us for enthusaism in life<sep>. The Spirit which flows forth from Jesus Passover is the origin of the spiritual life He changes hearts not our works but the action of the Holy Spirit in us # GeneralAudience<sep>. I express my closeness to the thousands of migrants refugees in Libya I never forget you I hear your cries and pray for you We are all responsibile for these our brothers and sisters who have been victims of this serious situation for too many years Let us # PrayTogether<sep>. Jesus have mercy on me Let us make this prayer our own today Let us repeat it We must ask Jesus who can do everything for everything He can not wait to pour out his grace and joy into our hearts # GospelOfTheDay<sep>. In the # GospelOfTheDay Mk 104652 the faith of Bartimaeus the blind beggar shines He asks everything of the One who can do everything Have mercy on me He doesnt ask for a favour but presents himself he asks for mercy on his person on his life<sep>. To live out a mission means cultivating the sentiments that Jesus has, to believe with Him that those around me are also my brothers and sisters. May His love reawaken our hearts and make us all true missionary disciples. #WorldMissionDay https://t.co/xTjcVjmq2J",M,pontifex

175,"If we make consistent effort based on proper education we can change the world We are selfish thats natural but we need to be wisely selfish not foolishly selfish We have to concern ourselves more with others wellbeing thats the way to be wisely selfish<sep>. The only thing that will bring happiness is affection and warmheartedness When you have a more compassionate mind and cultivate warmheartedness the whole atmosphere around you becomes more positive and friendlier You see friends everywhere<sep>. Anger and aggression sometimes seem to be protective because they bring energy to bear on a particular situation but what needs to be acknowledged is that that energy is blind It takes a calm mind to be able to consider things from different angles and points of view<sep>. Materialistic values can not give us peace of mind So we really need to focus on our inner values our true humanity Only this way can we have peace of mindand more peace in our world<sep>. Please dont think that compassion love and tolerance only belong to religion They belong to human life From compassion we develop selfconfidence that brings inner strength allowing us to act with transparency and candour<sep>. In order to develop our mind we must look at a deeper level Everyone seeks happiness joyfulness but from outsidefrom money from power from big car from big house Most people never pay much attention to the ultimate source of a happy life which is inside not outside<sep>.

On the occasion of the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP26 HHDL speaks on the need to tackle climate change as the future of our planet is in our hands <url><sep>. These days its realistic to work for coexistence on global level Its no longer appropriate to thinking only of my country We must educate the young in the ways to achieve genuine world peace taking the entire world the whole of humanity into account on a global level<sep>. Everyone wants to live in a peaceful world but its necessary to understand that what destroys peace is anger and hatred This is why the long term goal is to create inner peace within individuals so contributing to a more compassionate humanity<sep>. Compassion in Action HHDLs message to the 8th Parliament of the Worlds Religions held virtually on October 1718 2021 <url><sep>. Whats past is past nothing can change that But the future can be different if we choose to make it so We have to cultivate a vision of a happier more peaceful future and make the effort now to bring it about This is no time for complacency hope lies in the action we take<sep>.

HHDL sends 90th birthday greetings to Archbishop Desmond Tutu followed by a short talk on compassion in his message to the 11th Annual Desmond Tutu Peace Lecture on October 7th 2021 <url> <url><sep>. If you are motivated by a wish to help on the basis of kindness compassion and respect then you can do any kind of work in any field and function more effectively with less fear or worry not being afraid of what others think or whether you will ultimately reach your goal<sep>. In my experience what we need is a calm mind and warmheartedness provides a basis for that Thats how we make ourselves happy as individuals in families local communities and nations If we can train those who are young today in these qualities well create a happier world<sep>. When affectionate relations exist between members of a family each one is confident of being able to call on the others for support In a similar way we must constantly remind ourselves of the oneness of humanity<sep>. Negative emotions like attachment and anger are part of our lives but there are antidotes to them We need to reflect not only on the damage anger and fear can do but also on the benefits to be found in cultivating compassion and nonviolence and find a balance between them<sep>. Creating a more peaceful world requires a peaceful mind and a peaceful heart As human brothers and sisters we must live together with affection and respect The only way to solve human problems and preserve the peace is to meet talk and engage in dialogue # PeaceDayChallenge<sep>. HHDL engaged in his morning meditation practice at his residence in Dharamsala HP India Photo by Tenzin Jamphel <url><sep>. The direction of our lives needs to be positive We werent born to cause trouble or do harm to others For our life to be of value I think we must develop good human qualities warmth kindness compassion Then our life will become meaningful and more peaceful happier<sep>. We all have a responsibility to educate our human brothers and sisters Inner values are the ultimate source of happiness not money and weapons whether youre talking about individuals or the whole of humanity<sep>. Even though our society doesnt emphasize it the most crucial use of knowledge and education is to understand the importance of more wholesome action and disciplining the mindessentially the development of a good heart<sep>. HHDL talks about the need for universal responsibility for the whole of humanity to learn to live happily together <url><sep>. It can sometimes seem as if one person will not be very effective However change in the world always begins with an individual who shares what he or she has learned and passes it on to others<sep>. As soon as I wake up I think about altruism I reflect on the verse that says So long as space remains I will remain in order to serve sentient beings This gives me inner strength and determination so theres no longer any danger of destructive emotions arising<sep>. Helping others brings deep satisfaction No matter how powerful we may seem to be our survival depends on the community Clearly the community is crucial to individual happiness so if we make others happy we too derive benefit<sep>. Peace in the world depends on peace within If we have that well approach problems in a spirit of dialogue compassion and respect for the rights of othersalways a better solution than resorting to a use of weapons and force External disarmament depends on inner disarmament<sep>. We should show one another love and help each another It is a mistake to pursue happiness and to seek to the avoid suffering by deceiving and humiliating other people We must try to achieve happiness and eliminate suffering by being generous and warmhearted<sep>. Since we desire the happiness that comes from having a calm mind and such peace of mind arises only from having a compassionate attitude we must make a concerted effort to develop compassion We must use all the events of our daily life to transform our thoughts and behavior<sep>. Education today needs to include principles such as compassion and nonviolence Whats more since we are missing something if we are physically fit but full of anger and anxiety we need to learn about emotional hygiene tackling destructive emotions to find peace of mind<sep>. Like anyone else I too have anger in me However I try to recall that anger is a destructive emotion Scientists say anger is bad for our health it eats into our immune system It destroys our peace of mind We shouldnt welcome it or think of it as natural or as a friend<sep>. We are social animals If someone is angry with you its important to remain warmhearted towards them Todays enemy may become tomorrows friend If they behave negatively towards you and you are hostile in return therell be no end to the trouble between you<sep>. In seeking to find the source of happiness within us we need a map of our mind and emotions We need to understand how to manage our emotions how to counter those that are negative and cultivate those that are positive That is the way to find peace within<sep>. The problems humanity faces today demand a positive mental attitude and a sense of compassion for others I firmly believe we can solve the majority of our problems by developing a sense of universal responsibilitywanting to do something for others without a selfish motive<sep>.

HHDLs message for the International Religious Freedom Summit 2021 held in Washington DC USA on July 1315 2021 <url><sep>. Happiness derived from mere physical comfort tends to be shallow and fleeting It fails to pacify anxiety and fear Whereas if we have a calm mind it is effective in overcoming even physical pain therefore we should not neglect the inner values that are a source of a calm mind<sep>.

HHDL reunites online withArchbishop Desmond Tutu from his residence in India on June 24 2021 on the occasion of the release of their new movie Mission Joy Finding Happiness in Troubled Times <url><sep>. We should use our unique human intelligence to solve challenges we face and never give up or tell ourselves theres no hope If we have a positive goal and were wellmotivated to seek the wellbeing of others no matter how difficult it is to achieve we can remain determined<sep>. I am determined to help young people in any way I can because they are the future of the world And the first step in establishing good communications with other people is to smile I dont like formality Theres no formality when we are born nor when we die<sep>. If we want to see a more peaceful world we have to learn to collaborate Young people shouldnt follow previous patterns of behaviour New conditions like our interdependent globalised world require new ideas Dividing people into us and them is out of date<sep>. People face difficulties in many parts of the world but since all seven billion of us live on this one planet we should be united and stand in solidarity with each other When this blue planet is viewed from space there are no national boundaries to be seen<sep>. Im a human being a citizen of a world in which we are all dependent on each other a world in which we need a greater sense of concern for the welfare of others Wherever I go I like to meet members of the public so I can share these ideas with them<sep>. Today there is too strong a sense of us and them Theres too much sense of my friends or my enemy But we can change that Im committed to the idea of the oneness of humanity As human beings we are all the same Whats more we all have to live together on this planet<sep>. Entering into dialogue and talking things through is the only proper way of restraining people intent on perpetuating violent conflict It is important to make clear that in the 21st century old ways of thinking such as dependence on the use of force are no longer appropriate<sep>. People today may feel anxious about the future but we can take strength from the fact that more and more of us are genuinely concerned to protect the environment taking account of the welfare of the whole of humanity as well as the health of the planet our only home<sep>. The ability to smile seems to be unique to human beings As social animals we need friends Friendship is based on trust and trust grows when we show each other genuine affection If we are honest truthful and of service to others we can also feel selfconfident<sep>. Our intelligence helps us regulate our emotions Fear for example is based on mistrust and a lack of selfconfidence If on the other hand we remain honest and truthful open and tolerant we will not only have greater selfconfidence well easily overcome fear<sep>. There is time for us to create a better happier world but we cant sit back and expect a miracle We each have actions we must take by living our lives meaningfully helping others whenever we can and making every effort to do them no harm<sep>. Our lives depend on hope If you have hope youll be able to overcome problems you face But if youre without hope your difficulties will increase Hope is linked to compassion and loving kindness<sep>. Im sorry to learn that my good friend Gandhian environmentalist Shri Sunderlal Bahuguna has passed away Some years ago he asked me to spread the word about the importance of planting trees and caring for them whenever I can and I promised to do so <url><sep>. Peace of mind and physical wellbeing are closely related Some years ago a scientist at Emory University told me that continuous anger fear and suspicion tend to eat into our immune system Besides peace of mind and warmheartedness bring us confidence<sep>. We are selfcentred and selfish but we need to be wisely selfish not foolishly so If we neglect others we too lose We have to support others We can educate people to understand that the best way to fulfil their own interest is to be concerned about the welfare of others<sep>. Gradually people are beginning to recognize that peace of mind has an important role to play in our day to day lives Mental afflictions like anger fear and frustration detract from our good health so all seven billion human beings alive today need peace of mind here and now<sep>. When were born our mothers show us compassion This is a natural response without which we wouldnt survive Our lives begin with an experience of kindness and compassion Mothers Day is a good day to remember how important compassion can be<sep>. HHDL speaks on Emptiness and Compassion as Antidotes to Destructive Emotions as part of the Science amp Wisdom of Emotions Summit organized by Mind amp Life Institute and the Awake Network on May 5 2021 <url><sep>. Everybody knows that love and compassion are important Now the time has come when were experiencing the limitations of material values Were facing many unnecessary problems So gradually were returning to our basic human values with a new appreciation<sep>. At this critical time, during this alarming Covid-19 surge, I have asked the Dalai Lama Trust to make a donation to the PM-CARES Fund as a token of our solidarity with our Indian brothers and sisters. https://t.co/JOmAv9bCrC",M,dalailama

181,Recognise the location Recognise the stance Notice the influence of T20 has crept in with that first shot Reverse sweep <url><sep>. Dindigul Dragons missing their talisman player <url><sep>. I thought so But I wasnt sure that was the only reason or whether there was something else in the setup <url><sep>. 22 to get from 7 balls and Shahrukh Khan takes Tamil Nadu home They are doing something right to have a record like that in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Shahrukh has been one to watch for a while but so too Sai Kishore Thoughts @<user> @<user><sep>. I have heard and watched so many inspiring cricketing tales Here is another one The Sweet Sound Of Wood has done an excellent job capturing the perseverance shown by our players @<user> BrillianthttpstcoaWysqZ198E # paisabazaar # sweetsoundofwood # brandfilm # ad<sep>. @<user> Timeline might be a problem for you Always better to breathe a bit Take care<sep>. Enjoyed this conversation <url><sep>. Yes there are fans way beyond # RCB but that was one of the great relationships at the # IPL Bengaluru fans said they would make ABs 100th test a home game for him And you just had to hear them go ABD ABD Was special @<user> <url><sep>. Lara genius AB genius <url><sep>. @<user> Geniuses<sep>. There is no doubt in my mind that @<user> has been one of the most influential players of his generation A genius a true successor to Lara Wish you well AB I am sure your countless fans at @<user> will want to give you a befitting sendoff You were a great combo<sep>. @<user> How old are you Yash<sep>. @<user> We didnt<sep>. @<user> You know the situation there better but everyone deserves a second chance and sometimes people emerge stronger from mistakes<sep>. I have seen that change with people I have worked with too And it is welcome which is why I am hopeful that out of this turmoil a more aware and understanding generation will take root 44<sep>. But they had to change amp the effect has been remarkable They have rules but the illbehaved snobbish rude people seem to have been replaced Hopefully with the greater awareness of hurt the new generation will be more open amp will call out discriminatory behaviour 34<sep>. that will change I have seen change at Lords for eg It was a terrible disgusting place to go to people looked down at you were rude made you feel they were putting up with you for having to let you in In the 90s and at the turn of the century I hated going there 24<sep>. A lot of the time racism is hurtful amp intentional Sometimes it is in the air part of what seems an acceptable spectrum of behaviour Seemingly fair amp reasonable people will do or say things because no one has called it out amp it seems okay to do so Post # AzeemRafiq 14<sep>. For young people who may not be aware of what attitudes towards make up and grooming were this will be a very interesting read from a market research and consumer behaviour expert # RamaBijapurkarhttpstcon6dlFUQQGX<sep>. I suspect Australia will have to go back to Steve Smith as captain Pat Cummins would be a deserving candidate but as a large hearted fast bowler who gives every spell everything he has and plays all three formats his workload will need to be managed<sep>. Novy Kapadia loved all sport but football was part of him You could see joy reflected on him when he talked football in any case with Novy joy and happiness was rarely far away Few gave as much to his profession as Novy did A sports lover of the greatest purity<sep>. @<user> Haha now you only need to look for 9<sep>. Rahul Dravid as coach and VVS Laxman as head of the NCA are excellent appointments not just because they were great cricketers but because they have an outstanding work ethic love Indian cricket deeply are givers and as important as anything else are very honest people<sep>. A very happy birthday to @<user> When on song he was such fun to watch Just the kind of no 6 India could do with today Yusuf bhai har saal ki tarah yeh saal bhi enjoy karen<sep>. So good to see @<user> and @<user> playing starring roles for their franchise in Australia We need to get our # WIPL up and running soon<sep>. @<user> Will happen by and by I am sure And for that we will need the IPL to throw up a crop of 567 kind of players<sep>. Agree with Rohit Sharma that people must play similar roles in the Indian team that they do day in day out in franchise cricket No 567 are specialist positions too<sep>. In 1930 having regained the Ashes the Australian team played a game in honour of Jack Ryder It included the prodigiously talented Archie Jackson who sadly died at 23 of tuberculosis His signature is on this bat too It should be a collectors dream<sep>. Sharing a fantastic opportunity for collectors A bat from 1930 with signatures of Bradman McCabe Ponsford Woodfull etc to raise money for <url> Ian Chappell thinks the top six on that bat were the best for Australia It is an initiative for # Aust4UNHCR <url><sep>. @<user> @<user> He is one of our brightest talents Words obey him<sep>. @<user> Itne meethe shabdon mein agar koi bayaan kare to kubool karna mushkil nahi Dhanyavad<sep>. Another tournament another chance for Team India to prove their mettle New captain new coach What can the men in blue do to win this next battle against New Zealand # YahanSearchKhatamKaro # IndiavsNZ # Ad <url><sep>. That is very kind of you Dan I am and I am being completely truthful in awe of some of the people I have worked with this last month <url><sep>. @<user> And you must get even better<sep>. Enjoyed it Great crew Very pleasant experience <url><sep>. Post tournament emptiness is difficult to explain Excited about going home again but there is an emptiness on the periphery Normally lasts about a day<sep>. # Australia just too powerful What a player Mitch Marsh has become Hopefully his body becomes a partner in his future because he is too good to be playing as little he has Brilliant today<sep>. 172 is a fine score in a big final But I dont think it is safe We have a fabulous game on our hands<sep>. 4 overs 316 in a T20 final is worth its weight in gold Hazlewood gets better and better at T20 cricket<sep>. The sign of a great batsman Got to love how Kane Williamson has switched gears without a slog in sight This is a stunning innings 1819 then 5120<sep>. Lovely surface by the looks of it The people in charge of the pitches have done a phenomenal job Would love to see a score of 175 and a chase worthy of a final<sep>.

Lovely <url><sep>. @<user> He could have played two testsat least one<sep>. A simple explanation could help Selectors can have their reasons for picking or dropping players Explaining their thinking makes it easier for the fans and prevents theories from sprouting Not too late yet <url><sep>. 7261 runs in fc cricket avg 55 21 100s Has only played one test innings in India In the West Indies he had scored of 32 93 111 52 Has batted wherever asked saved a test match in Australia This was such a good opportunity for him in home conditions Perplexed <url><sep>. Am I missing something here I can not see a reason why # HanumaVihari is not in the test squad for # IndvsNZ Injury Cant be on cricketing groundsthere hasnt been any firstclass cricket Surely it cant be right His last innings for India was that heroic effort at Sydney<sep>. @<user> Interestingly there was no dew yesterday<sep>. When Finch and Williamson go out to toss on the 14th the dugouts will be more tense than they would be in the death overs # TossToWin<sep>. Hands on heart how many had predicted an # AusvsNZ final I must admit I had England Pakistan and India as my favourites But two sensational run chases later they deserve to be there<sep>. I know sport can sometimes be cruel but I can not see children crying<sep>. You would have thought that if one team could make 176 look enough it was Pakistan But this Australian team has just got better and better as the tournament has progressed<sep>. Twice in two days we have thought the bowling side had it covered Twice it has ended with an over left There is no limit to what these hitters can get now<sep>. WowMathew Wade Who would have imagined a finish like that Hitting of the very highest order<sep>. What <url><sep>. Top innings from Warner but that wicket was the game changer Pakistans game to lose now<sep>. With any other bowling side this would only have been a par score <url><sep>. And to think they didnt pick him in the first place Fakhar Zaman has given Pakistan a total that their bowlers should be able to defend<sep>. They are getting it <url><sep>. Pakistan need a big finish from their power hitters now. They are a bit behind where they would have liked to be.,M,bhogleharsha
